Is it meant as a joke?The supporting evidence is just numbers pulled apparently from nowhere (“let’s assume…”) and the conclusion is wildly off base.They seem to imply that if optimization improves the performance of much of the world’s software, by 4% each year, then it’s a waste of time.Murphy’s law is the only comparison given.I wonder what the comparative expense is to develop faster and faster hardware, vs.to keep improving compilers.Depending on how the ROIs compare, (in dollars-per-percent gain, let’s say) maybe this “law” is worth some weight.OTOH, the Postgres article in question seems to show diminishing returns from optimization, which belies the whole premise of the “law” which assumes the gain is consistent from year to year.

Does it optimize on the SQL or algorithm level?", "For the databases I've used, which excludes PostgreSQL, most optimization happens on algorithmic level, that is, selecting the best algorithms to use for a given query and in what order to execute them.From what I gather this is mostly because various different SQL queries might get transformed into the same \"instructions\", or execution plan, but also because SQL semantics doesn't leave much room for language-level optimizations.As a sibling comment noted, an important decision is if you can replace a full table scan with an index lookup or index scan instead.For example, if you need to do a full table scan, and do significant computation per row to determine if a row should be included in the result set, the optimizer might change the full table scan with a parallel table scan then merge the results from each parallel task.When writing performant code for a compiler, you'll want to know how your compilers optimizer transforms the source code to machine instructions, so you prefer writing code the optimizer handles well and avoid writing code the optimizer outputs slower machine instructions for.

After all the optimizer is programmed to detect certain patterns and transform them.Same thing with a query optimizer and its execution plan.

It gathers pre-computed column statistics, like counts of rows and distinct values, to estimate the number of rows a query is likely to match.It uses this information to order joins and choose indexes, among other things.Joins can be accomplished with several different algorithms, like hashing or looping or merging.The cheapest option depends on factors like whether one side fits in working memory or whether both sides are already sorted, e.g.

thanks to index scans.", "It would arguably be more accurate to compare the actual systems running Postgres and their precompiled binaries. Nearly everything else in a given system running a given version of an application may have an impact on its performance in subtle ways.Its development occurred in conjunction with these other system components, thus it was optimized for them.In addition, distributions tend to ship their binaries with patches not found upstream which can also affect performance.Everything from the kernel and scheduler to glibc and more may affect performance.Newer isn't always faster.

Even the containerization you now use might add a subtle penalty that an older non-containered version may not experience.Basically, it's theoretically possible that some old ass system running version 8 runs it faster than your current system runs version 8 (excluding hardware).Add to that all the other usual caveats about benchmarks etc (like the fact that IO wasn't tested here but is pretty dang relevant to real world performance)"]}, {"Title": "Caching secrets of the HTTP elders, part 1 (csvbase.com)", "Link": "https://csvbase.com/blog/8", "Comments": ["This makes me feel old.IM amused by some of the JS community acting like server side rendering and hydration is akin to discovering fire when they just brought back progressive enhancement from circa 2009.Next week we're going to have a lesson on semaphores.On a more serious note, there are a lot of places where we could take some lessons from the past to heart.

It’s great that it works for you, but I don’t think that’s applicable to me :)", "Using something you build brings a lot of satifsaction.", "I haven’t studied the topic enough, but it would be very interesting to see when this dichotomy of money-making vs. self-interest really embedded itself into the act of creation.Somewhere during the Industrial Revolution, I suppose.But I also think the default mode of “art as self expression” plays a big part, and that’s more early-mid 20th century.Because when you read about creators during say, the Renaissance, you don’t really have this much of a dichotomy.Da Vinci worked on a paid portrait project, and then did unpaid experiments on his own which ended up being useful for his paid projects.It was a very loop-like thing and I think he would find the explicit framing of “I’m doing this to make money” and “I’m doing this purely to create something I want to create” as alien.

Ditto for most forms of art in most parts of the world, prior to the late 19th century.The solution, I think, might be to focus primarily on the craft and not on the end product. You see this a lot with early 20th century fiction writers that moved in and out of journalism, with the idea that they were becoming better at the craft of writing, not at creating a final product or “being a good fiction writer.”", "Whilst visiting Florence, I found out that Michelangelo is broadly considered the first artist to set his own price for his work.Before him, the patron would go “I need this cathedral painted” and the patron would also decide how much to pay the artist (generally they’d be paltry sums).

With Michelangelo, the patron would go “I need this cathedral painted,” and Michelangelo would go “sure, that’d be 400 golden florins, take it or leave it.” There are stories of him not delivering his work when the patron decided to change the price after the fact.On the topic, I think that if the “money-making” bit is defined broadly enough, then it merges very well with self-interest. Like if someone asked me to make a remix of a song, but then how I’d do that is left completely up to me, it’s a broad enough task as to feel like I’m in control.At that point, there’s very little of the feeling of “I’m doing this for money.”", "In the sense of the article artists have always done their best to cater to the taste of the people who might pay them.At least from the 16th century.They were typically paid for and protected by a mecenas (wealthy Merchant or nobility).

If you have an example of artists in the distant past lamenting the fact that they can’t do what they want and instead must make art for money, I’d be glad to read them.I didn’t say people today aren’t creating the best possible work, I said this focus on the juxtaposition between the market and the self seems like a recent thing to me.", "Depends on how you define \"lamenting\". Unless there are diaries of the artists in question, it is very difficult to know the private thoughts of people in the distant past.That said, there are certainly well-documented stories of artists being forced to change their work because of (unreasonable) demands from their patrons.One example is the Windsor guildhall [1], where the architect was forced to add extra columns \"for safety reasons\" even though he knew they were unnecessary and even though they conflicted with his artistic vision.

He was clearly unhappy with this and made them all an inch short of the ceiling as a demonstration to later generations, even though it was impossible to see this from ground level so he still got paid.Michelangelo would also appease his patron (gonfaliere Soderini) while he was present, famously by faking the altering of the nose of his statue of David. Then some years later while Soderini had fled to Rome for unrelated reasons, Michelangelo publicly made fun of Soderini and mentioned that he only worked for him because he paid so well [2].These are just some examples that readily came to mind, I'm sure there are many many more.

It implies several things that aren't true:* That a hobby done for profit that can't also be done for fun.* That a hobby for profit can't start as a profit-making venture, but turn into a passion.* That work should be the only route to wealth.* That optimizing for wealth can't go hand-in-hand with fun.I despise the adage that a hobby is only a hobby if you aren't making money from it.

Most of what I build, I sell. If I didn't, I would neither be able to afford the hobby nor store the stuff I make.It would end up in a landfill.Parts of the hobby I took up explicitly because they demand higher prices when I sell it, but now they're some of the things I'm most passionate about.Realistically, I'd love to do it as a full-time venture, but the semiconductor industry pays well and I'm not a famous maker so couldn't make it work - as the article states well enough.To suggest that hobbies can't both be fun and profitable though is a philosophy I think should be quashed.", "And after a while, your hobby if physical will take space for things that are done, and that you don't need anymore.So why not resell them and fund the next steps ?", "You raise another good point; is all monetization of a hobby the same?No, of course not.

\"Etak\" refers to a system of navigation used by Micronesian and Polynesian seafarers to navigate from island to island in the vast Pacific Ocean. Much like this device, it operates by \"augmented dead reckoning\" (as it says in TFA).The etak system of navigation involves navigating by stars and ocean swells to get the heading, but a key issue when navigating by dead reckoning over long distances is that if you're a fraction of a degree off you may miss your destination and never know it, so it's also vitally important to know how far you've gone.This is hard when there are no landmarks.The navigators estimated their distance by using intermediary islands off to the side, which they viewed as coming towards them (from their point of view, the navigator stays motionless on the open ocean while the world moves towards them) and past them.

These reference islands were called etaks.However, confusingly, the etaks were generally not visible, being beyond the horizon, and sometimes did not even exist. The navigators would have named etaks that they pictured being just over the horizon, whether they were there or not, and would track their procession past their boat.When the set number of etaks had passed, they would know they were in the vicinity of the destination island.If they were not at the right time of day for birds to be out, they would then hang out in the area waiting to spot the birds leaving or returning at dawn or dusk.So the system involves dead reckoning plus a system of turning the navigators' own well-developed intuition of how far they had travelled into a formalized system of generally-invisible islands that they used as a mental model to externalize this intuition.(My knowledge of this is from Cognition in the wild, Hutchins, E., 1995.)Edit: D'oh, I should have finished TFA.

This is described at the end, although more roughly.", "I've read somewhere that part of the method they intuited their way was to read the waves. As faraway land masses can affect the shape of waves, supposedly these navigators could \"see\" beyond the horizon due to how the swell was behaving.I can sort of see that in a mind's eye, with rings of waves spreading as they bounce off obstacles in water.But that's bird's view of a miniature -- and seeing that from the surface would be a very different story.", "https://worldhistorycommons.org/marshall-islands-stick-chartIt’s amazing they can read such nuance.", "Look at something long enough, and you begin to intuit the patterns instinctively.", "Instinctive things are things the entire species are born with.Things you pick up via experience (“nurture”) can never be “instinctive”.", "Instincts are not limited to natural instincts.> 1.A natural or inherent impulse or behaviour.> 2.

It does sound like a very complex system based on the beginning of this article; I'm wondering if anyone here has read the books mentioned in it: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20705519", "The explanation could be a combination of experience, details, survivor bias and true scottman.That is with experience you can select something on the ocean far away that you can track (kelp, etc), with experience and focus to accurately track it and take into account its own movement. Then the method is obviously only promoted by those who successfully survived using it, as the potential nay-sayers who used it and failed are no longer there to give a counter-point.Finally, those who did not use it successfully are probably characterized as \"not good navigators\", in circular logic.", "I've found a bit more information about the topic in a publicly available research article [1]:\"A depth of only 25 fathoms is quite enough to give some surface indications: coloration, wave phenomena, perhaps fauna.

Is this the explanation of the ghost island? Some lost traveller, perhaps en route from Yap to Guam, seeing and remembering these phenomena, later reifying them as an inhabited land?Or is it possible that a real island once existed here, as the Carolinians say?[...] Any Carolinian navigator worthy of the name can give a whole set of radiating courses under all the navigation stars from every island of the Carolines, not just from Kaafiror.[...N]avigators do learn them, together with the courses from real islands, and they make no distinction among them.

It is perhaps not altogether in the realm of fantasy to speculate that the curriculum of the schools of navigation was established in a time when Kaafifor was more than a discolored patch of water.\"[1] https://micronesica.org/sites/default/files/the_ghost_island...", "You know how if you turn the light on for a second you can then move through a dark room without touching anything?The boundary between \"imagining\" and \"visualizing\" is somewhere between these two experiences but conceptually they are not that different.", "Yeah, this surprised me as well. I get how reading ocean swells, sea life, birds, ocean color (indicating depth and/or plant life below) could give a general sense of position.And I can see how stars, prevailing currents and maybe even estimates based on the relative movement of clouds (adjusted for ambient wind direction and weather conditions) could give a general sense of distance traveled.

But on a completely cloudless day (or fully overcast night) gauging distance traveled seems like it could be catastrophically imprecise often enough to make for short navigation careers.I'm not sure how the concept of tracking virtual islands over the horizon really helps. The only thing I can think of is maybe the idea of it encourages the navigator to stay focused on estimating the passage of proxy points on the far horizon based on whatever composite of wind, current and swell signs they are intuiting from.While still quite variable, I assume gauging distance estimates on the far horizon is better than the alternative of trying to estimate distance traveled from the immediate surroundings of the craft (which are only useful for estimating velocity).", "> I'm not sure how the concept of tracking virtual islands over the horizon really helps.

The only thing I can think of is maybe the idea of it encourages the navigator to stay focused on estimating the passage of proxy points on the far horizonYou can practice navagating against physical islands over the horizon, and when you're good at that, you've mostly gotten good at dead reckoning against a real reference point; of course, with corrections from the islands influence. Having a community shared archipelego of virtual islands lets you focus your dead reckoning skills on a point while offering a vocabulary of distance and reducing travel times between waypoints.Go 1000 miles in this direction seems a lot harder for me to follow over many days than go X miles to A, then Y miles to B, then Z miles to C.Even if A and B aren't real.

Overlay the GPX on a map later and it's super obvious whether I took the exit or not, but either the Apple location provider or Waze staunchly ignores reality in favor of obsessive road snapping.)Where this gets stupid is, if there's a traffic jam on the freeway and I dip onto the exit to avoid it, now Waze sees me flowing freely down the service drive, assumes that it's the freeway that's flowing freely, and disbelieves other users who report traffic there.

Now at 32, unemployed with a spotty resume and no prospects, I could really use a &pointer (or reference ;))Reading through your comment and picturing my own upbringing (poor, abusive, but I guess I got a handle on it and discovered programming through gaming eventually, it does make me sad that although there were hand-me-down computers available that I gravitated toward and experimented with, I could not picture where the nearest library was, and had to Google it now.

I'm not particularly resentful though, I did get out, and I'm grateful for that.I wonder if the books alone would have been enough, but having the books and the physical escape together is kind of incredible, and it's heartening to hear you used the hell out of that space.Much earlier on, I had some exposure to small motors, and had some mentorship from my extended family on the programming front, but didn't really have a sense of how to build on that; no conception of how to connect motors with gears in a more complex system, no business exposure at all, no ability or framework for learning how to execute on any project, and just a debilitating lack of motivation up until around 17, along with no appreciation for the idea of proving myself measurably; I thought I was capable, but apparently wasn't.

I got my little bots for Runescape running though, and that was empowering.Thankfully, I did and continue to have a similar refuge at the skatepark, which provided me some social and physical benefits for free, much like your basketball league, that a surprising amount of people I meet now don't have. I was nerdy, but couldn't execute, and couldn't see how I'd get there.My first job was a glimpse into how much potential there was available; I made more than my father who I was on good terms with, but then I was laid off for lack of reason to have me on the payroll, which took a positive signal and turned it into hopelessness in a way.I experienced adult job loss my first time trying.It was a great opportunity that I relish in some ways still.

I then got another job as a frontend developer, making a bit more, and then burnt out, slowed down, and got fired, partially because I was trying to do CSS things that nobody was paying me to do, instead of just writing some JavaScript to handle dynamic layout and getting the job done. I was too deep in the weeds and got stuck there, but the idea of just cranking out things quickly wasn't stimulating enough and I'd just sit there trying to convince my brain to do the work.Since then, it's just been gradual pay increases, some early freelance clients that worked out for a while, but at this point I've never held a continuous job for longer than a year and a half, and I feel like the pieces of minor success are hard to stabilize, despite being in a wildly better situation still than I'd ever have imagined in high school, and a hell of a lot of personal inward reflection.

My last job title was Software Engineer II, but really I'm just a generalist that keeps failing upward, and I don't know whether if I were to double-down and specialize more, go deeper, or pivot out completely, I'd be able to do that well; it's a bit of a constant existential crisis.

It's hard to be consistent over a long period of time without a manager deciding I was a liability or me just burning out so badly, or a series of unfortunate life events coming together for the negative, and once you're out, it's extremely hard to get back in.For the last year, I've been working my way through Nand2Tetris, because in a career highlight I landed an actual interview with Apple (that ended up going nowhere, rightfully so because my lowest level knowledge didn't exist) as well as building a small SwiftUI project that may or may not see the light of day, and while I think those are positive moves, it's going to be a hard year ahead that may take me to net zero again unless I can pick up something in general labor for while (Waiting tables would be quite difficult without a solid short-term memory, and don’t believe someone would hire me for that with largely tech experience and random interspersed menial work).Anyhow, ultimately I wholeheartedly agree with your sentiment, those little shifts really do add up for either the positive or sometimes negative.

I think the longer you can keep them positive, keep the ball rolling forward, the more likely things will work out, and as a society it's crucial we continue making it possible to smooth out the experience of life, especially for people who grow up in volatile situations.", "> My last job title was Software Engineer II, but really I'm just a generalist that keeps failing upward, and I don't know whether if I were to double-down and specialize more, go deeper, or pivot out completely, I'd be able to do that well; it's a bit of a constant existential crisis.As a generalist that still has the title Software Engineer after over 25 years of experience, I think I am able to empathize. I think, if you are a generalist and, like me, if you like \"laying the pipes\" to connect things end-to-end and see the satisfaction of having built the entire thing, embrace it.

You should be proud that you can build a complete application though OS infra to database to backend services to frontend UIs and provide the glue of scripts as needed, all by yourself (not shitting on working in a team setting, just knowing that you could).

As in, I can set up a database, build an API, wrangle a vps, and then build the front-end, but I don't really have much of a sense of how to do it quickly or by using decoupled cloud service providers, simply because I've never been in that position.

Laying the pipes is sort of the essense of productive software engineering in my mind.It is quite gratifying though to gradually be working my way to understanding how each layer of the hardware software stack work, and I'm starting to see those layers in real-world contexts, such as in getting a fault when compiling Swift, it'll show me the lower levels where the problem occured.", "> Most of my work has been jumping into some crazy existing codebase and figuring out how to understand and contribute to it, so greenfield buildouts are just not something I've repped out, and think that's a bit of a weakness.Without any context of the details of the work, one thing that has helped me is to lookout for scope of improvements beyond on the codebase itself. E.g.is there opportunity to provide a UI to the end-users of the code base.

If so, since you have touched the codebase to contribute to it, your suggestion to work on those things to improve end-user's life may get accepted and then you have something relatively greenfield to work on. Doesn't always work out that way but sometimes it might.Another approach is building something on the side that you know will be very useful, even though nobody asked for it - helps you figure out the quick way of doing it (what you mentioned) since these are POCs and you can't repeatedly spend too long on them.", "Really good suggestions, thanks.

Oh, well then you'll be shopping again 3 times this week. Maybe even 4 times.I hope you like waiting in the sun/rain, LA Metro only puts up cover where they can make money off advertising, so all the bus stops we've used only have benches (except one, but that one's further away).If all you needed was medication, you'll probably want to get your shopping done anyways, as this is otherwise a > 2hr trip just for that (remember, bus 2 is hourly, so you're spending an hour at the shopping center _minimum_, including walking to/from the bus stop).There's five other stores across the street from the shopping center that you'd like to check out sometime, including a new grocery store, but it takes 20 minutes to cross the shopping center, then probably another 10 to cross the street and the parking lot in front of the other stores.Add the time spent in these stores, and you've just added another hour to your shopping trip.

This is only _partially_ offset by crossing to the supermarket pharmacy, as that supermarket is nowhere near the corner, and keep on kind that anything you have to carry will slow you down more.-----Buses:- Bus 1 goes EW near home, turns NS between home and the transfer point (about 10 minutes), then goes EW again.- Bus 2 goes EW, turns NS between the shopping center and transfer point, and goes EW again.- There _was_ a bus that went NS along the east side of the shopping center (which also would have dropped me off at home, cutting out the need for a second bus entirely), but this bus route was changed in 2019 to turn away from the shopping center once it gets to the NE corner.- There's a bus that goes EW along the other side of the shopping center, but that's not helpful.-----You're forgetting about just how much convenience your car gives you _besides_ the ability to get to and from the store.- You don't have to wait for transfers or make what is effectively two trips to get somewhere.- You don't have to cross parking lots or go in and out of stores from the street (you can park up near the store, then drive to the other side of the shopping center).- You can make a quick 5 minute stop on the way home without increasing your travel time by a full hour (because the bus only comes hourly).- You don't have to wait outside.- You don't have to hope that the bus was cancelled without notification (two weeks ago I was lucky to get a ride, as my once-an-hour bus was straight up cancelled without prior warning; if I didn't use the former-official Transit app to check times, I wouldn't have known, and would have been waiting at the stop for 80 minutes like one of my less fortunate coworkers did, or taking a different once-an-hour bus home with extra transfers and lots of waiting, to only get home ~10 minutes earlier)- You don't have to only buy as much as you can carry on a single trip (I work in a grocery store, people can and do fill _multiple_ shopping carts to avoid having to go shopping a second time in a week.

People can and do purchase groceries for elderly relatives they don't live with).- if there's a detour, it only costs you the time it takes to make said detour. If the bus has to make a detour and you have tight timing, you might miss your transfer, adding 10-60 minutes to your commute.- You're not dependent someone being willing to pick you up.When I was in college, a full bus would often just go right by without stopping, since there wasn't enough room.- You're not dependent on your fellow passengers being rule-abiding or polite.Last year the bus driver stopped for an entire 50 minutes at a high school because the kids weren't being safe or quiet.

Not that they're ever quiet, or that a full bus in general is quiet, but they were throwing condoms across an overcrowded bus and yelling, and the bus driver understandably didn't want to deal with it when _he couldn't close the door_, so he stopped and said those past the yellow line on the floor needed to get off and wait for the next bus. Instead, they made fun of him, continued talking loudly, and those near the door who shoved their way into a full bus refused to move.(The next month or so was _very_ quiet on the bus)- general garbage is everywhere.The filth that people leave behind when they cram into a bus and then leave.The noise of competing music playing against each other.

Having the choice to either get up and lose your seat, or sit with someone's butt in your face because another busy bus broke down and yours is the first/closest bus going in the same direction.- All you want to do is go home and go to sleep, but you don't want to get the bus in your bed and this sweaty dude's been sitting here talking in your ear for 15 minutes now and you wish you hadn't offered him a seat, and as soon as he leaves you realize the person behind you is yelling on the phone and now you have a headache.", "Canada is about to become a 2nd world country.

That's hardly an export, especially since a lot of this knowledge was taken without our permission and in violation of laws we set out to try and avoid other people getting it.I suppose \"coming up with the idea for something\" is a good enough definition for exporting the manufacture of it, but it seems much simpler (and less egotistical) to say that \"China used our scientific discoveries to advance itself\" instead of \"we exported manufacturing to China\".", "> It is surely a great critique of the western system that China giving us stuff for free made us poorer.I mean... is it?I can think of a few times that something previously expensive is suddenly made very cheap, and there's always a class of people that really don't do that well.The closest situation I can think of is when the west was dumping food in africa [0][1].

Which made it harder for local farmers to make a living and made the food problems worse.Unless you're talking about switching to an autocratic system where the elites can turn down cheap things in exchange for the long term benefits of local production. And, in theory, China might be able to, in theory, do that.I don't know their elite culture well enough to say otherwise.

But modern Western elites definitely seem too short sighted to give that sort of power, so the critique seems like it falls flat.[0]: https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/14/world/americas/14iht-food...[1]: https://www.npr.org/2006/10/13/6256274/u-s-european-subsidie...", "> I can think of a few times that something previously expensive is suddenly made very cheap, and there's always a class of people that really don't do that well.Obviously this will be somewhat true in the short term, but there is no reason these people can't just retrain and start doing something different.> Unless you're talking about switching to an autocratic system where the elites can turn down cheap things in exchange for the long term benefits of local production.It wouldn't have to be autocratic. For instance, our system is not an autocracy, yet we chose to move manufacturing to China.Not every system that makes decisions is autocratic.

People could just as easily vote to do something democratically if they know it is in their own good.But consider what is really happening in these places. They have an economic system which makes decisions about the allocation of resources.In response to the addition of new resources, these systems decided to decrease production of local resources below existing levels, and hence make people poorer as a result.The issue here is purely one of distribution and management.Suppose in the trivial case of food being dumped in Africa, said food was instead sold below market rates, and the income from this was used to subsidise farms to bring their outputs to the same price as the aid.Local manufacture remains worthwhile, prices decrease, and supply increases.Everyone benefits.I don't think it should be crazy to envision an economic system stable enough to allow people to benefit when you give them things for free.

I certainly saw this happen to people I knew, one of them lived with us for awhile and my folks arranged for her to live with a relative, which allowed them to really make it in life instead of being stuck in the system. Weirdly, after some initial trouble that looked impossible to overcome, it was very simple to get them placed into our home, and, very simple to get them in with a relative.Most of that was the workings of the social worker assigned to them, who was hard to reach out to, and very clearly over worked.Basically, there has to be a better intervention than just taking people's children away, which certainly keys into your points.I'd take it further to the point where, the poverty line is re-evaluated per locality, and inflation needs to be accurately reported, and with it the tax brackets as required by law.Then we need to dump the tax burden completely off the lowest earners, along with their requirement to file taxes at all.

Then, we need to re-evaluate the bottom tiers to ramp in slowly to help eliminate welfare traps. It'd probably be a good idea, additionally, to no longer tax things like unemployment/workmen's comp/disability/social security/etc, for similar reasons.Reporting taxes itself is a burden all its own, and it negatively affects people who already struggle with math.Also, something that isn't currently done, and certainly should be done, is to create interactions between the kids who have poor situations with the kids that have good situations.My elementary school had a 'buddy' program, where the older kids would hang out in a structured way with the younger kids.I think it'd go a long way in terms of support to have a system where kids from the good side of town interact with kids from the bad side of town in that way, and to make it a K-12 program.

Frankly, though, I actually think they know these things but have perverse incentives to keep the population stratified.This country would financially crumble without the abuse of those in poverty for every one of those 7 generations, if not more.I think managing this pool of exploitable resources is actually a primary component of most govs immigration strategies.", "I'm really surprised that you consider it a \"sacrifice\" to help others.

That's a government trying to get more tax income than what they are entitled to, hidden under the guise of simplification. We are equal under the law, and therefore, theoretically, we are equal under taxes.It is irrelevant that someone has, or does not have access to such a canteen, if they are not making use of the facility, the net outcome is the same, and therefore, the taxation should be the same.And then a point could be made about the relevancy of taxation in the canteen example.(Although it should not be forgotten that it was just a randomly quantified example for the sake of argument).But let's say that company A decides to provide a canteen, with food sold at cost price to its employees.This turns out to be 20% cheaper than eating in a random other canteen \"at market price\" (i.e.

charging you for cost price + company B profit).Now you are actually taxing the fact that company A decided to make the effort to setup a canteen, hire cooks/canteen employees, probably make a qualitative effort to offer better food, and not seek profit on the effort, when compared to company B, offering food at a higher price as it includes profit.Congratulations, in a context of decreasing food quality offered by catering services world-wide, your taxation approach just further de-incentivized potential quality over taxation income. Further fully disregarding the fact that to offer a catering service, company A had to make investments, is employing personnel, buying food, etc, and is, therefore, already contributing more to global tax revenues for the state.Furthermore, you are also unfairly putting non-profit catering services at a disadvantage, as, they too will be taxed more, as they are also offering their food below \"market price\".

The 31.4% is not subtracted from your payout but just paid by your employer (or yourself, if you are self-employed).

By this, I mean you can't ignore it, it is a strong sensation.So much, that the guides will advise to do the flight on an empty stomach.And it was overpowering, one girl in the plane did not watch anything because she was focused on a paper bag close to her mouth.Not even fast turning karts or anything else has been able to reproduce that feeling.", "Not everyone has it even initially; it really varies from person to person.I suspect that to some extent it is influenced by past exposure to fast-paced first-person games (e.g.FPS when played using the mouse).", "I used to get nausea when playing Doom in the nineties, it never got better.But I never get nausea from fps games with slower movement.

I suspect the problem with Doom is how quickly you can change direction while running. You can run quite fast and a 90 degree turn doesn't slow you down at all.", "In pretty much any FPS that allows using the mouse to turn (which was already the case even in Wolf3D), you can turn as fast as you can move the mouse.When playing competitively, and with experienced players in general, it is common to set mouse sensitivity rather high, allowing one to perform very fast - but still highly precise!- turns, either to follow the target, or to switch rapidly from one target to another, or to scan the area etc.Really good players can do what's known as a \"180 quickscope\" like that, which is exactly what it says on the tin - a very rapid 180 degree turn & aim to shoot someone you know is behind you.Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEC4AE6KbxYIf you don't have experience doing this yourself, watching such a player over the shoulder can be very nausea-inducing.

I think to some extent this is innate, but I suspect for those who don't have a strongly pronounced response to begin with, playing such games (and doing those rapid turns yourself) desensitizes you over time.

Initially I got a strong sense of de-realization / depersonalization after getting out of the digital world (i.e.looking at your hands and your brain being confused if they're real) But that also went away very quickly.The nausea, and 'am I still in the matrix' feeling got better within days, and went away within weeks.Now I can stomach any crazy topsy-turvy locomotion in any game.But I still feel the sweat and excitement, when swinging off 1000 feet high cliffs in Jet Island, or diving hundreds of meters deep in Subnautica.It's just amazing how immersive it can be.

My biggest beef with the game is how slow the ship is to turn in combat and that I can’t do strafing.", "FA Off, or Flight Assist Off, is the mode in Elite Dangerous where your ship does not correct any momentum (angular or linear) that you have, except for imposing speed limits. In this mode, you will be using 6 strafe thrusts and 6 turning controls, and it's entirely up to you to use them to cancel momentum if you want to stand still or fly in a controlled direction.It is absolutely incredible to play like this, and very hard but rewarding.It can be essential for high level combat, and there's an entire community of hooners (sp?) that fly among narrow spaces between mountains doing incredible maneuvers.They use extra things like opening the cargo hatch or landing gear as aerobrakes (lower ship speed limit).Many \"normal\" pilots will enable and disable Flight Assist situationally, mostly to gain extra turning speed during FA OFF.

It's worth searching youtube for some related videos.Unfortunately for mouse/keyboard users like me there's a couple of things in the control scheme that conspire to make it harder to use than it could be. Still, the first time I landed my Cutter (a massive ship with brutal inertia) in a rotating station with FA OFF, I felt like the king of the world.Note that you don't need FA OFF to do strafing in all directions.I do it all the time.However with FA ON, the ship will counter your strafes to correct the ship's motion into the forward/back axis.Strafes in FA OFF are more powerful and can let your ship move at top speed in any direction while facing any other direction, but you only really need that for tight flight maneuvers.", "That sounds quite a bit like decoupled mode for star citizen.

But I agree it's not as big as it could be, and that the magic hasn't really been recaptured. Game developers seem to frequently have this same thought.Descent was good!This should be more popular!Someone tries every couple years or so, but the result generally disappoints.It is my opinion that 6DOF games are difficult to make good, especially to the standards and expectations of modern gamers.The combat and level design are much more technical (or perhaps just differently technical) than someone from a flat FPS perspective expects, and as a result, the game design seems to have a lot of opportunities for technical mistakes to be made.I think more generic FPS developers, who remembered liking Descent back when our standards were lower, don't realize how much we've learned since then and how very much there is TO learn about the genre.I find that aggravating.

Every few years, the Descent community gets excited about a big 6DOF attempt, and every few years we get disappointed by the result. Even more aggravating, they generally make design mistakes that I think show ignorance of the genre.How does this keep happening?You wouldn't think of making an RTS, or a MOBA, or even a flight combat sim, or really any other very technical genre of game, without the expertise of the veterans and elite players of the genre.And yet 6DOF developers seem to me to do just that.I can only conclude that the problem looks from the outside to he easier than it really is.I don't mean to sound arrogant!What I mean is that, I think the answer to your question \"Why isn't this more of a thing?\" is that it's a much harder thing than it appears to be.

I think Descent's success can be attributed to a lot of things: to lower standards 30 years ago, to lucky or prescient design decisions, to a brilliant team enjoying the unique freedom of the wild world of 90s software passion projects, and to a lot of community involvement over time. And I'm not sure that's the whole list.I do think it should be a bigger thing now - there is a delicious flavor here and no reason this generation shouldn't love it too.But it's also apparent that Descent caught lightning in a bottle, and even I couldn't tell you everything that went into making it happen once but not twice.I can point to reasons that I think attempts to repeat it have been less successful, reasons that make sense to me as an expert player in the genre, problems I think I or a couple dozen pilots like me could help anyone avoid.But I'm not sure that explains all of the difficulty.

Every now and again, some veteran pilot will take the problem into their own hands and try to make the next big 6DOF, and those projects are rarely finished and rarely good. It doesn't seem that hard, from a software point of view, and they know the game!Or think they do.And yet they fail.So genre expertise can't be the only ingredient, even if I think it's a necessary and usually missing one.The problem is clearly harder than it looks.I think I know what to do, or at least one piece of the puzzle, but better warriors have been slain on that battlefield, and I haven't actually made the attempt, so I don't actually know.But I can definitely say this much: Developer beware!Here there be dragons!Overload's good though.:)", "Expanding on this:when you add the extra degrees of freedom in Descent-like games, relative to Quake-like games (or flight/space sims but in different ways), there are some emergent behaviors that change how the game fundamentally feels.

What frequently happens when random devs take on a 6dof project because they enjoyed Descent back in the day is they'll make a game that feels like a shooter with vertical flight, and is missing some of the key things that make Descent feel good. I've heard some 6dof games described as \"it feels like I'm flying a camera, not a ship\" (lack of turning momentum), or \"it feels sluggish when I try to move in multiple directions\" (lack of vector independence / trichording), or \"it's just spray-and-pray combat\" (undersized ship hitboxes relative to projectile speed/size and level size.) There are a lot of things we've learned over 30 years of playing Descent and Descent-like games that don't always get taken seriously by devs of other 6dof projects.

And even when they do take everything seriously, there are things none of us have figured out how to articulate but that can make a 6dof game feel bad.I think it'd be possible to build a great game in the genre, but you'd need a bunch of key things to come together, and then you'd also need great marketing to get the thing in front of millions of eyeballs to make enough sales to keep the community going.", "Hellbender on PC was a good one too", "Terminal Velocity and Fury3 before it...", "I think it's called 6dof games.", "There's a weird effect where sometimes one game in a genre will become so iconic that nobody wants to try and make another one, possibly out of fear of seeming like they're ripping it off? It happened to Descent, and I feel like it happened to e.g.Myst as well - everyone was expecting the huge success of Myst to launch a whole genre, and then it just...didn't.", "Myst may not have launched a genre, but it did establish its own kind of game style.3D world.

But they were basically the same game.I don’t even know if 7th guest was first of its kind, probably not, but it sold bucket loads, partly because it was a pack in game for MPC kits and PCs in the early 90s.", "Zork Nemesis one of my favorite games from the 90's was heavily inspired by Myst it was one of the first games I played where I felt immersed in the game world.", "Nowadays this is the walking simulator genre with hundreds of titles available, but certainly I agree that it took an extremely long time to truly become its own thing.", "I think Myst's innovation was mainly using a first-person perspective with (pre-rendered) scenes of a continuous 3D world. Otherwise it was a point-and-click adventure that arguably didn't reach the heights of some earlier Lucas Arts games.Unfortunately these games went out of fashion because most people want some amount of real-time action in their games.

But they still get made occasionally by smaller developers on Steam or Android/iOS.", "> I think Myst's innovation was mainly using a first-person perspective with (pre-rendered) scenes of a continuous 3D world.The 7th Guest was released months earlier. It’s the exact same genre and technically more ambitious.It uses FMV, but all the 3D worlds are pre-rendered.I think it is should be obvious to most here why Myst was more generally successful.But outside of story and atmosphere (the former of which is porn plot in both) mechanically they’re the same game.", "There's Telltale games, but IIRC they are more visual/interactive novels, and I believe there were new Sam and Max games, classic adventure / point and click games.And a new Monkey Island.", "There are other adventure games but without such established names behind them.So hardly anyone knows about them.", "Wikipedia mentions another Myst innovation:> The series caused a major shift in the adventure game genre.

Unlike previous games, Myst attempted to keep players immersed in the world by removing all information not associated with the fictional world itself—no explanatory text, inventory, or score counters.", "My view is that both Myst and Descent were compelling at release because they showcased new technologies.For Myst it was a high res 3d modelled world you could traverse, interspersed with video clips, all made possible by the new CD-ROM tech. It wasn’t actually that great a game.I loved it at the time but in retrospect there’s just not that much there.The most recent incarnation of a game like this is The Witness which is better in every way I can think of.For Descent it was true 3D - was it the first?It predates quake.Maybe some people were captivated by the gameplay but for me it was “holy shit it’s 3d”.There’s a reason we have tons of FPSes and only a few Descent clones; the latter just aren’t that fun for most people.", "There were tons of Myst clones that came out after.

The most prominent example was probably Rama, based on the Arthur C. Clarke novels.But lots of others like Shadow of the Obelisk, Obsidian, etc.", "There were quite a few myst like in the 90s.Lighthouse: The Dark Being is one I enjoyed as a kid.\nRheah is another one during that period.\nCryo released an entire series of Myst like with Atlantis (not great though).Mystery of the Nautilus and Return to Mysterious island are decent though.So, I'd say there were plenty of myst-like clones mostly focused on the European market though and not necessarily very successful.", "The Sims was like that too, and it's only recently that anyone's tried to launch a full-blown competitor, Life By You from Paradox, who also launched a full blown SimCity competitor, Cities: Skylines.It's run by Rob Humble, who managed The Sims 2 and 3.Myst was the top selling game of all time until The Sims came along and dethroned it for quite some time.

So you have a point about how some top selling games can become so iconic that there aren't any alternatives for a long time.I think it's a great thing that Paradox eventually picked up the ball and made some competition for SimCity and The Sims, after EA strayed from the original designs, and enshitified them with all the expansion packs and online DRM bullshit.Competition is great, and The Sims 4 and SimCity and the competing alternatives would be much better off and further along, if they only had viable competition all these years.

EA should have released and documented and supported their internal content creation and programming tools for user created content, instead of putting all their effort into competing with fans and trying to squeeze the last penny out of it with expansion packs.I've proposed and campaigned for EA to release the tools since before the release of The Sims 1 in 2000, and they did eventually give me the rights and pay me to develop and release some limited tools like The Sims Transmogrifier for The Sims 1, but they never followed through with releasing the internal tools like the Edith editor and SimAntics visual programming language, or the 3D Studio Max content creation tools, and they never officially supported or documented anything, the way Factorio and other games do such a wonderful job at.This video shows Edith -- The Sims Steering Committee - June 4 1998:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC52jE60KjYAnd this shows The Sims Transmogrifier and some other tools I developed with it, and user created content programmed by fans with the limited tools available (iffpencil2 etc) -- Demo of The Sims Transmogrifier, RugOMatic, ShowNTell, Simplifier and Slice City:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imu1v3GecB8Decades later, it's now possible but difficult to develop and program user created content for The Sims 4 in Python, but it's terribly documented and practically unsupported.

Here is the original proposal I wrote around the time we released The Sims 1 in March 2000, which outlined what we should do, but unfortunately they didn't take it nearly as far as I suggested, and never let me release the 3D Studio Max animation and object exporters, or the Edith editor and visual programming tools.https://web.archive.org/web/20040329181128/http://www.donhop...>A Proposal to Develop Third Party Content Authoring Tools for The Sims, by Don Hopkins, March 2000>This is a proposal I wrote to Maxis after The Sims was released in March 2000, outlining some of my ideas for third party content authoring tools that I could develop.

This led to The Sims Transmogrifier, but it touches on several other interesting tools and projects that Maxis never got around to.>Problem Definition:>There is a strong demand many from third parties who want to develop their own custom content for The Sims, including characters and objects.>Proposed Solution:>Update, clean up and document the content creation tools, so third parties can make their own characters and objects for The Sims.>Port the tools to the latest version of 3D Studio Max.>Make the tools self contained so they can be run stand-alone, by removing all dependencies on the Maxis environment and expensive software packages: Character Studio (Biped, Physique), Access, SourceSafe, MKS Toolkit (Korn Shell).>Document the content creation tools with an overview, examples, tutorials, and a reference manual. Write down the folklore that has been passed by word of mouth.

Read over the code and document how it actually behaves.>Provide consulting, training and content creation services to third parties who want custom content authored for The Sims, but don't want or know how to do it themselves.>Develop a Sims Content Authoring SDK, so it's possible for third parties to create specialized content creation tools, like FaceLift.>Goals:>Third Party Character Creation and Customization:>Characters include virtual people who the user can play with, as well as autonomous non-player characters with programmed behaviors.

Characters consist of bodies, heads and hands of 3D polygonal meshes with texture mapped bitmap skins.>Characters are created at Maxis by highly skilled artists using expensive tools like 3D Studio Max, Character Studio, the CMX exporter, and Photoshop.>Simplify the content creation tools and make them run stand-alone, so third party artists and designers can create their own characters and objects.>Maxis' expert 2D character artists currently use Photoshop to paint body textures in layers, then flatten and dither them into 256 color bitmap files.>\"Flesh out\" the process of applying layered clothing to naked bodies and dithering to 8 bits, so anyone can dress up their characters in all kinds of clothes.>Maxis' expert 3D modeling artists create textured low-poly rigid meshes (like heads, hands and accessories) attached to individual bones, and the CMX exporter creates rigid suits.>Make the CMX exporter easy for third parties to use, so many proficient 3D artists will be able to make their own textured heads, accessories, selected character pointers, and carried objects.>Maxis' expert 3D character modeling artists attach textured low-poly deformable meshes (like bodies) to skeletons using Character Studio Physique and Biped, and the CMX exporter reads out the weighted vertex/bone bindings and creates deformable suits for the game.>Character Studio is an expensive plug-in that enables a skilled artist to bind deformable meshes to skeletons, but there are other ways to do that with 3D Studio Max and other 3D tools.>Enhance the CMX exporter to support Max's new way of attaching deformable meshes to skeletons, so third party 3D artists can create bodies.>Maxis designers and programmers use the Edith tool to configure the behavior of characters and objects.>Clean up and document Edith, so third party designers and programmers can program and modify their own characters and objects.>Third Party Object Creation and Customization:>Objects consist of pre-rendered z-buffered sprites, packaged together with character animations, sound effects and programmed behavior.>Objects are created in-house at Maxis, by highly skilled 3D modeling artists, using lots of polygons and detailed texture maps in 3D Studio Max.

The sprite exporter breaks the objects up into tiles and renders them in different scales and rotations, then writes out z-buffered sprites.>Clean up and document the sprite exporter, so third party artists can use it with 3D Studio Max to make their own objects.>The sprite exporter is very specific to 3D Studio Max, especially when breaking apart multi-tile objects.>Maxis' expert 3D character animation artists create skeletons and animations of characters interacting with objects.

They use Character Studio Biped, although the exporter supports other types of skeletons, like the bones built into Max or even hierarchies of normal objects.>Clean up and document the CMX exporter, so third party character animators can use it with 3D Studio Max with or without Character Studio to make their own character animations.>Enable Third Party Content Creation Tool Development:>Develop and document an SDK (Software Development Kit) that gives third parties the information they need to make their own content creation tools for The Sims.>Enable and encourage the development of tools like FaceLift and Blueprint by third parties.>A \"BodyLift\" tool that enables anyone to mutate, breed and tweak deformable body meshes, like FaceLift lets anyone do with rigid head meshes.>A skin tool that enables anyone to layer clothes and accessories on different bodies, skin colors, sexes, ages, etc.

Allow artists to create 32 bit alpha masked layers of clothing that can be applied to any body.>An animation tool that enables anyone to create their own dance sequences, walk loops and idle animations, by mixing, cross fading and mutating between many pre-existing dramatic poses, dance moves, walks and idle loops.>Specialized object creation tools that enable anyone create their own customized objects from templates, like a PictureFramer that would create a framed picture from any bitmap, or a JukeboxFactory that would create a jukebox full of your favorite mp3 files.", "Forsaken.

My parents had forbid me from touching anything in the \"WINDOWS\" folder (there be dragons, according to them) and after having wiped a lot of my mom's files on our earlier Tandy, they didn't want me messing with things I didn't understand that they couldn't fix.But I was confidant. I edited the file, and hoped for the best.The computer restarted, and just as I'd done countless times before to no avail, tried to start up the game.Listening to the Star Wars theme play MIDI over the speakers, I jumped up, ecstatic.It was late at night, and my parents were watching TV in the living room.I ran downstairs.\"I GOT X-WING WORKING!!!!!!\"It was a feeling of accomplishment, that to this day I look back on and say \"that's when it started\".I think I knew it then, to some tiny degree, that this was going to be my path.I'm 40 now.I'm a solutions architect at AWS.My computers were all built by me.

The current internet and computer environment doesn't have that in that you need to know how it works in order to enjoy it. I wouldn't reverse the state of affairs; things are much more mature and stable now.And it's not as simple as saying \"well go off and do these projects\".We can motivate some to do so as a stretch, but nothing was motivating the same way as sheer necessity like we had it.So I see it as just something to observe and note and appreciate for how we had it then, both maddeningly frustrating yet glorious in how genuine and unrefined it all was.Hopefully later generations will find their own versions of what we experienced.I'm glad to have lived through it.It kick-started a love of computing and a lifelong career.", "Some friends of mine played Descent competitively, and I was amazed to learn about so-called trichording: to maximize your speed, you need to press multiple keys at the same time to travel along all 3 axes at once, e.g.forward/right/up.

So people learned to pulsate it multiple times per second so that it would recharge between the fraction-of-a-second uses and keep at ~95% all the time instead of quickly dropping to low figures.So if you wanted to go really fast you'd both run diagonally in three dimensions and keep pulsating the afterburner multiple times per second.", "It wasn't really considered either a bug or a feature by the original designers, it was just not something they put any thought into. After it was discovered, some designers had a negative opinion of it, others had a positive opinion, and it was a point of contention when the team got together to make Overload after years away from Descent.

My wife and I tried some alternatives (by modding D1) and flew a demo for Mike/Matt/Luke/Dan and whoever else was in the studio that day, and eventually settled on \"vector independence just feels good\" which is why Overload has the ability to change from a normalized flight mode with faster 1D flight into the trichording mode.", "In the competitive ladders some of the best used rotation to \"steer\" in curved paths when trichording.It made people really difficult to hit when you were behind them.I played against some ladder players and was amazed at their other order of magnitude skill.Part of the reason those og games were so compelling to me is because they didn't really have a skill cap.It would have been amazing to watch some of those matches in a streaming platform.", "In 2D, the diagonal across a 1x1 rectangle is longer than just its sides.A naive implementation of just adding the x and y vectors together will become their sum, totaling up to the diagonal length, 1.41x faster.

In 3d even more.This is a very common bug (feature) in many old games.Quake famously did consider this bug while walking but not while jumping, leading to a more complicated trick to speed up called strafe-jumping.", "Yeah looks like the calculation doesn't renormalize the final thrust vector after adding together the component inputs.

A simplified example for a 2d game would be like this: var playerX_input = Input.GetHorizontal(); // float in range -1 to 1\n var playerY_input = Input.GetVertical(); // float in range -1 to 1\n\n var playerVelocity = new Vector2(playerX_input, playerY_input);\n // The player can now move 1 unit/frame in X and 1 unit/frame in Y, which means that if they're moving diagonally, the length of their velocity vector is the length of the vector (1,1) which is sqrt(2) (~1.41)\n\n // This can be corrected by doing something like\n if(playerVelocity.length > 1)\n {\n playerVelocity = playerVelocity.normalized();\n }", "> Some proprietary sound and video libraries from Interplay have been stripped out (the ACM and MVE format).

My brother installed DEVIL, and I learned how to launch things from DOS, interact with a CLI and filesystem, and of course make my own levels.We got Internet service and then D2 multiplayer, facilitated by Kali/Kahn for match-making completely blew my mind. I think I was 12 or 13, and discovering things like IRC and webpages describing advanced techniques like chording were hugely eye-opening for how big the world was.Making friends on ICQ, and discovering warez was like living in a sci-if novel.I also got into building and upgrading PCs to be able to play at higher resolutions and frame rates.Descent 3 was a huge step forward graphically, and brought about sniping with the mass driver.It had worldwide rankings, and making the top 100 leaderboard as a 16 year old still ranks as one of my most mind-blowing moments.It was the first time I had high speed internet, and really ushered in the modern era of gaming for me.Thank you for this.

Is it meant as a joke?The supporting evidence is just numbers pulled apparently from nowhere (“let’s assume…”) and the conclusion is wildly off base.They seem to imply that if optimization improves the performance of much of the world’s software, by 4% each year, then it’s a waste of time.Murphy’s law is the only comparison given.I wonder what the comparative expense is to develop faster and faster hardware, vs.to keep improving compilers.Depending on how the ROIs compare, (in dollars-per-percent gain, let’s say) maybe this “law” is worth some weight.OTOH, the Postgres article in question seems to show diminishing returns from optimization, which belies the whole premise of the “law” which assumes the gain is consistent from year to year.

Does it optimize on the SQL or algorithm level?", "For the databases I've used, which excludes PostgreSQL, most optimization happens on algorithmic level, that is, selecting the best algorithms to use for a given query and in what order to execute them.From what I gather this is mostly because various different SQL queries might get transformed into the same \"instructions\", or execution plan, but also because SQL semantics doesn't leave much room for language-level optimizations.As a sibling comment noted, an important decision is if you can replace a full table scan with an index lookup or index scan instead.For example, if you need to do a full table scan, and do significant computation per row to determine if a row should be included in the result set, the optimizer might change the full table scan with a parallel table scan then merge the results from each parallel task.When writing performant code for a compiler, you'll want to know how your compilers optimizer transforms the source code to machine instructions, so you prefer writing code the optimizer handles well and avoid writing code the optimizer outputs slower machine instructions for.

After all the optimizer is programmed to detect certain patterns and transform them.Same thing with a query optimizer and its execution plan.

It was a very loop-like thing and I think he would find the explicit framing of “I’m doing this to make money” and “I’m doing this purely to create something I want to create” as alien. Ditto for most forms of art in most parts of the world, prior to the late 19th century.The solution, I think, might be to focus primarily on the craft and not on the end product.You see this a lot with early 20th century fiction writers that moved in and out of journalism, with the idea that they were becoming better at the craft of writing, not at creating a final product or “being a good fiction writer.”", "Whilst visiting Florence, I found out that Michelangelo is broadly considered the first artist to set his own price for his work.Before him, the patron would go “I need this cathedral painted” and the patron would also decide how much to pay the artist (generally they’d be paltry sums).

With Michelangelo, the patron would go “I need this cathedral painted,” and Michelangelo would go “sure, that’d be 400 golden florins, take it or leave it.” There are stories of him not delivering his work when the patron decided to change the price after the fact.On the topic, I think that if the “money-making” bit is defined broadly enough, then it merges very well with self-interest. Like if someone asked me to make a remix of a song, but then how I’d do that is left completely up to me, it’s a broad enough task as to feel like I’m in control.At that point, there’s very little of the feeling of “I’m doing this for money.”", "In the sense of the article artists have always done their best to cater to the taste of the people who might pay them.At least from the 16th century.They were typically paid for and protected by a mecenas (wealthy Merchant or nobility).

There are no doubt exceptions but in general the art was to please their mecenas.", "Right but (and I could be wrong here) it seems like lamenting this is largely a recent thing. Renaissance artists were focused on creating the best possible work, not lamenting that they had to make paintings for money and not for their own desires.", "You are making quite the assumption there.There are quite a few among us focusing on creating the best possible work.And there are quite a few back then who did the opposite.Wouldn't you wonder where the conception that things were different came from?", "As I said, I could be wrong.

If you have an example of artists in the distant past lamenting the fact that they can’t do what they want and instead must make art for money, I’d be glad to read them.I didn’t say people today aren’t creating the best possible work, I said this focus on the juxtaposition between the market and the self seems like a recent thing to me.", "Depends on how you define \"lamenting\". Unless there are diaries of the artists in question, it is very difficult to know the private thoughts of people in the distant past.That said, there are certainly well-documented stories of artists being forced to change their work because of (unreasonable) demands from their patrons.One example is the Windsor guildhall [1], where the architect was forced to add extra columns \"for safety reasons\" even though he knew they were unnecessary and even though they conflicted with his artistic vision.

He was clearly unhappy with this and made them all an inch short of the ceiling as a demonstration to later generations, even though it was impossible to see this from ground level so he still got paid.Michelangelo would also appease his patron (gonfaliere Soderini) while he was present, famously by faking the altering of the nose of his statue of David. Then some years later while Soderini had fled to Rome for unrelated reasons, Michelangelo publicly made fun of Soderini and mentioned that he only worked for him because he paid so well [2].These are just some examples that readily came to mind, I'm sure there are many many more.

The concept of patronage has existed at least since Roman times, and very much implied that the artists involved would spend their time glorifying their patron instead of just doing \"what they want\".[1] https://inel.wordpress.com/2007/02/09/sir-christopher-wrens-...[2] https://100swallows.com/2007/09/22/michelangelo-as-a-backbit...", "I would place somewhere between the 1970s and 1980s.

I'm passionate about fantasy/sci-fi miniature building/painting, terrain modelling, and prop making.I love the expression of taking a universe that exists within the realms of novels and movies, and bringing it to the real world - to scale or in miniature.I design STLs/CAD models for 3D printing, scratch together terrain boards for people to play games on, paint miniatures any hour I get free, machine parts for various outfits and armaments, and spend hours fantasising about what universe I'm going to delve into next.None of that would be possible if I didn't monetise the process.

Most of what I build, I sell. If I didn't, I would neither be able to afford the hobby nor store the stuff I make.It would end up in a landfill.Parts of the hobby I took up explicitly because they demand higher prices when I sell it, but now they're some of the things I'm most passionate about.Realistically, I'd love to do it as a full-time venture, but the semiconductor industry pays well and I'm not a famous maker so couldn't make it work - as the article states well enough.To suggest that hobbies can't both be fun and profitable though is a philosophy I think should be quashed.", "And after a while, your hobby if physical will take space for things that are done, and that you don't need anymore.So why not resell them and fund the next steps ?", "You raise another good point; is all monetization of a hobby the same?No, of course not.

The navigators estimated their distance by using intermediary islands off to the side, which they viewed as coming towards them (from their point of view, the navigator stays motionless on the open ocean while the world moves towards them) and past them. These reference islands were called etaks.However, confusingly, the etaks were generally not visible, being beyond the horizon, and sometimes did not even exist.The navigators would have named etaks that they pictured being just over the horizon, whether they were there or not, and would track their procession past their boat.When the set number of etaks had passed, they would know they were in the vicinity of the destination island.

If they were not at the right time of day for birds to be out, they would then hang out in the area waiting to spot the birds leaving or returning at dawn or dusk.So the system involves dead reckoning plus a system of turning the navigators' own well-developed intuition of how far they had travelled into a formalized system of generally-invisible islands that they used as a mental model to externalize this intuition.(My knowledge of this is from Cognition in the wild, Hutchins, E., 1995.)Edit: D'oh, I should have finished TFA. This is described at the end, although more roughly.", "I've read somewhere that part of the method they intuited their way was to read the waves.As faraway land masses can affect the shape of waves, supposedly these navigators could \"see\" beyond the horizon due to how the swell was behaving.I can sort of see that in a mind's eye, with rings of waves spreading as they bounce off obstacles in water.

It does sound like a very complex system based on the beginning of this article; I'm wondering if anyone here has read the books mentioned in it: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20705519", "The explanation could be a combination of experience, details, survivor bias and true scottman.That is with experience you can select something on the ocean far away that you can track (kelp, etc), with experience and focus to accurately track it and take into account its own movement. Then the method is obviously only promoted by those who successfully survived using it, as the potential nay-sayers who used it and failed are no longer there to give a counter-point.Finally, those who did not use it successfully are probably characterized as \"not good navigators\", in circular logic.", "I've found a bit more information about the topic in a publicly available research article [1]:\"A depth of only 25 fathoms is quite enough to give some surface indications: coloration, wave phenomena, perhaps fauna.

Is this the explanation of the ghost island? Some lost traveller, perhaps en route from Yap to Guam, seeing and remembering these phenomena, later reifying them as an inhabited land?Or is it possible that a real island once existed here, as the Carolinians say?[...] Any Carolinian navigator worthy of the name can give a whole set of radiating courses under all the navigation stars from every island of the Carolines, not just from Kaafiror.[...N]avigators do learn them, together with the courses from real islands, and they make no distinction among them.

It is perhaps not altogether in the realm of fantasy to speculate that the curriculum of the schools of navigation was established in a time when Kaafifor was more than a discolored patch of water.\"[1] https://micronesica.org/sites/default/files/the_ghost_island...", "You know how if you turn the light on for a second you can then move through a dark room without touching anything?The boundary between \"imagining\" and \"visualizing\" is somewhere between these two experiences but conceptually they are not that different.", "Yeah, this surprised me as well. I get how reading ocean swells, sea life, birds, ocean color (indicating depth and/or plant life below) could give a general sense of position.And I can see how stars, prevailing currents and maybe even estimates based on the relative movement of clouds (adjusted for ambient wind direction and weather conditions) could give a general sense of distance traveled.

But on a completely cloudless day (or fully overcast night) gauging distance traveled seems like it could be catastrophically imprecise often enough to make for short navigation careers.I'm not sure how the concept of tracking virtual islands over the horizon really helps. The only thing I can think of is maybe the idea of it encourages the navigator to stay focused on estimating the passage of proxy points on the far horizon based on whatever composite of wind, current and swell signs they are intuiting from.While still quite variable, I assume gauging distance estimates on the far horizon is better than the alternative of trying to estimate distance traveled from the immediate surroundings of the craft (which are only useful for estimating velocity).", "> I'm not sure how the concept of tracking virtual islands over the horizon really helps.

The only thing I can think of is maybe the idea of it encourages the navigator to stay focused on estimating the passage of proxy points on the far horizonYou can practice navagating against physical islands over the horizon, and when you're good at that, you've mostly gotten good at dead reckoning against a real reference point; of course, with corrections from the islands influence. Having a community shared archipelego of virtual islands lets you focus your dead reckoning skills on a point while offering a vocabulary of distance and reducing travel times between waypoints.Go 1000 miles in this direction seems a lot harder for me to follow over many days than go X miles to A, then Y miles to B, then Z miles to C.Even if A and B aren't real.

If I treat them as very small islands that will be over the horizon, no big deal that they don't influence the environment, they're small; but I can't really use them to course correct, my reckoning needs to be good.", "This is a great point, and exactly analogous to waypoints used in aviation navigation, mostly for departure and approach patterns.", "It only happened in the late middle ages, after possibly millenia of experience navigating easier waters.

Overlay the GPX on a map later and it's super obvious whether I took the exit or not, but either the Apple location provider or Waze staunchly ignores reality in favor of obsessive road snapping.)Where this gets stupid is, if there's a traffic jam on the freeway and I dip onto the exit to avoid it, now Waze sees me flowing freely down the service drive, assumes that it's the freeway that's flowing freely, and disbelieves other users who report traffic there. Even as the service drive curves and diverges and I follow the curve, it doesn't retroactively say \"Oh jeez, he must be on the service drive after all, adjust the previous data to apply to the service drive and not to the freeway!\".

She was incredulous and told me to keep it up.That mattered!

I'd be curious if you had any major setbacks that you rebounded from after things started rolling successfully forward for you.

Now at 32, unemployed with a spotty resume and no prospects, I could really use a &pointer (or reference ;))Reading through your comment and picturing my own upbringing (poor, abusive, but I guess I got a handle on it and discovered programming through gaming eventually, it does make me sad that although there were hand-me-down computers available that I gravitated toward and experimented with, I could not picture where the nearest library was, and had to Google it now.

I'm not particularly resentful though, I did get out, and I'm grateful for that.I wonder if the books alone would have been enough, but having the books and the physical escape together is kind of incredible, and it's heartening to hear you used the hell out of that space.Much earlier on, I had some exposure to small motors, and had some mentorship from my extended family on the programming front, but didn't really have a sense of how to build on that; no conception of how to connect motors with gears in a more complex system, no business exposure at all, no ability or framework for learning how to execute on any project, and just a debilitating lack of motivation up until around 17, along with no appreciation for the idea of proving myself measurably; I thought I was capable, but apparently wasn't.

I got my little bots for Runescape running though, and that was empowering.Thankfully, I did and continue to have a similar refuge at the skatepark, which provided me some social and physical benefits for free, much like your basketball league, that a surprising amount of people I meet now don't have. I was nerdy, but couldn't execute, and couldn't see how I'd get there.My first job was a glimpse into how much potential there was available; I made more than my father who I was on good terms with, but then I was laid off for lack of reason to have me on the payroll, which took a positive signal and turned it into hopelessness in a way.I experienced adult job loss my first time trying.It was a great opportunity that I relish in some ways still.

I then got another job as a frontend developer, making a bit more, and then burnt out, slowed down, and got fired, partially because I was trying to do CSS things that nobody was paying me to do, instead of just writing some JavaScript to handle dynamic layout and getting the job done. I was too deep in the weeds and got stuck there, but the idea of just cranking out things quickly wasn't stimulating enough and I'd just sit there trying to convince my brain to do the work.Since then, it's just been gradual pay increases, some early freelance clients that worked out for a while, but at this point I've never held a continuous job for longer than a year and a half, and I feel like the pieces of minor success are hard to stabilize, despite being in a wildly better situation still than I'd ever have imagined in high school, and a hell of a lot of personal inward reflection.

My last job title was Software Engineer II, but really I'm just a generalist that keeps failing upward, and I don't know whether if I were to double-down and specialize more, go deeper, or pivot out completely, I'd be able to do that well; it's a bit of a constant existential crisis.

It's hard to be consistent over a long period of time without a manager deciding I was a liability or me just burning out so badly, or a series of unfortunate life events coming together for the negative, and once you're out, it's extremely hard to get back in.For the last year, I've been working my way through Nand2Tetris, because in a career highlight I landed an actual interview with Apple (that ended up going nowhere, rightfully so because my lowest level knowledge didn't exist) as well as building a small SwiftUI project that may or may not see the light of day, and while I think those are positive moves, it's going to be a hard year ahead that may take me to net zero again unless I can pick up something in general labor for while (Waiting tables would be quite difficult without a solid short-term memory, and don’t believe someone would hire me for that with largely tech experience and random interspersed menial work).Anyhow, ultimately I wholeheartedly agree with your sentiment, those little shifts really do add up for either the positive or sometimes negative.

I think the longer you can keep them positive, keep the ball rolling forward, the more likely things will work out, and as a society it's crucial we continue making it possible to smooth out the experience of life, especially for people who grow up in volatile situations.", "> My last job title was Software Engineer II, but really I'm just a generalist that keeps failing upward, and I don't know whether if I were to double-down and specialize more, go deeper, or pivot out completely, I'd be able to do that well; it's a bit of a constant existential crisis.As a generalist that still has the title Software Engineer after over 25 years of experience, I think I am able to empathize. I think, if you are a generalist and, like me, if you like \"laying the pipes\" to connect things end-to-end and see the satisfaction of having built the entire thing, embrace it.

You should be proud that you can build a complete application though OS infra to database to backend services to frontend UIs and provide the glue of scripts as needed, all by yourself (not shitting on working in a team setting, just knowing that you could).

As in, I can set up a database, build an API, wrangle a vps, and then build the front-end, but I don't really have much of a sense of how to do it quickly or by using decoupled cloud service providers, simply because I've never been in that position.

Laying the pipes is sort of the essense of productive software engineering in my mind.It is quite gratifying though to gradually be working my way to understanding how each layer of the hardware software stack work, and I'm starting to see those layers in real-world contexts, such as in getting a fault when compiling Swift, it'll show me the lower levels where the problem occured.", "> Most of my work has been jumping into some crazy existing codebase and figuring out how to understand and contribute to it, so greenfield buildouts are just not something I've repped out, and think that's a bit of a weakness.Without any context of the details of the work, one thing that has helped me is to lookout for scope of improvements beyond on the codebase itself. E.g.is there opportunity to provide a UI to the end-users of the code base.

If so, since you have touched the codebase to contribute to it, your suggestion to work on those things to improve end-user's life may get accepted and then you have something relatively greenfield to work on. Doesn't always work out that way but sometimes it might.Another approach is building something on the side that you know will be very useful, even though nobody asked for it - helps you figure out the quick way of doing it (what you mentioned) since these are POCs and you can't repeatedly spend too long on them.", "Really good suggestions, thanks.

That is, now that I see depression as a chronic condition I have (say perhaps analogous to people that have to deal with migraines), as opposed to something that I am at my core, it makes it much, much less scary and threatening to me.In my experience, I've noticed that the people who I think of as the most successful (both from a society-wide and personal perspective) have the clearest view of what is their control and what they can accomplish, and also what is not.

A huge benefit of this is that when they see an obstacle that some person could potentially overcome, even if it would be very, very difficult, they tend to think \"Heck, why not me?\" And when they do hit setbacks because of the unpredictability of the world, they don't take it personally, they just tend to think \"Well, the world is chaotic - is this new problem something that can reasonably be overcome?\" I contrast with a mindset I had for a long time (which a large part I think was a consequence of being bullied) that if I put a lot of effort into something and just didn't succeed, it was fundamentally because I wasn't \"good enough\", so why bother trying that hard at something else as I'm likely not going to be good enough there either.", "Very true.

If we increase it, there might be some company at the margin that will go without janitorial services, but most companies will pay their janitors the new wage, which (from the \"a worker costs $X and produces $Y\" model's perspective) will look a lot like the nation's janitors suddenly started producing more value.

Never is a long time.Getting the parents to show up and explain why the grades are bad will force them to consider why that is.

Even those who 'make it out' may struggle in ways not fully captured in the data or this visualization.I grew up in a 'high risk environment', and experienced all the adverse experiences with the exception of gun violence (yay Canada). I'm one of the few that 'made it out'.Many of my childhood friends are dead (usually overdoses), suffer from substance abuse, or are still stuck in the poverty cycle (on average it takes 7 generation to break the cycle).I look at this visualization and I can feel, to my core, what these folks feel.Even for those that 'made it out', I feel for them.I struggle with my mental health, I've had to actively reparent myself, and I feel pretty lonely.Many of the people I'm surrounded by don't know what it feels like to carry all the weight from your childhood.I do agree that the government shouldn't just throw resources at the problem.There are some things the government can do, though.1.Teach conflict resolution skills to young children.

This mitigates adverse experiences and prepares the children for adulthood (especially if they 'make it out')2. Address addiction as a health problem and not a criminal problem.Children don't need to see their parents as criminals, they need to witness them get better.3.Reduce the burden of poverty.For instance, the poorer you are the further you have to travel to the grocery store.The people who often don't have the means to easily travel for food have to travel for food.4.Access to education.The people I grew up around who have found success did so because our schools were really well equipped.You'll notice I didn't list access to support systems.Honestly, they are kind of useless.As a child you understand that if you open up about your experience there is a solid chance your parents will get in trouble or you'll be removed from your home.No child wants this.You end up holding it all in because you can't trust adults.These are just some of my thoughts.

A lot of my experience growing up in California during the 90s was \"tell an adult\" and \"zero tolerance\" coming down from school administrators.This is useful at a very young age, but it neglects to equip the children with agency for when the adults aren't around.You can't tell an adult when you're on the school bus and conflict breaks out.You can't tell an adult when you're out on a soccer trip and people are getting rowdy in the locker room.The bystander effect is very strong in school aged children because we neglect to introduce them to their inherent agency in conflict.There is also a degree of antifragility that parents could teach as well.Your emotions aren't reality.What people say about you isn't either.

Got some examples?", "I live in Los Angeles.Driving to work takes 15 minutes.Taking the bus _home_ from work takes an hour.Taking the bus _to_ work would require extra time -- leaving early to make sure I don't miss the bus.And this is only a 3-5 mile ride, where the bus picks up half a block from my work and drops me off a block from home.There's a shopping center with multiple markets and Walmart and Kohl's that the bus comes up along then turns away from on the way to work; I can use this as an example of shopping from home, as I can probably get 90% of my living supplies there.Ralphs, Target, Walmart, Kohls, Trader Joe's, etc are all here.

The bus transfer here is not an easy one, though, as the bus timings overlap going in both directions, meaning you have to leave early and get back later (about 1 in 4 trips I can transfer without waiting. _Not_ good odds with an hourly bus).0:00 5 minutes: walk to bus stop 1.0:05 5 minutes: wait for the bus (best to be at the stop early in case your bus is early, though this bus is usually exactly on time)0:10 10 minutes: take the bus to stop 2.0:20 3 minutes: cross the street to get on the other bus0:23 12 minutes: wait for the next bus 2, the previous one left while you were crossing (yes, seriously)0:35 10 minutes: take bus 2 to stop 3 where the shopping center is0:45 90 minutes: cross the parking lot to get to the store (5~10 minutes), then try and get all your shopping done in under 40 minutes so you can take the next bus back home.

Nope, today you had to go to the supermarket pharmacy, which is a 20 minutes walk across the shopping center, wait for your meds, _and_ walk back to the cheaper market to do your shopping as well.2:15 30 minutes: shopping is done a bit early. Yay.You have time to walk back to the bus stop and wait in the sun until the next bus 2 comes.Yay.2:45 10 minutes: Bus 2 comes.Take it back to the transfer bus stop.2:55 15 minutes: Cross the street again, and wait for bus 1 so you can get home3:10 10 minutes: take bus 1 home.3:20 15 minutes: Now you're a block away from home, carrying bags of groceries, _and you had to get off 2 stops early so you could use a crosswalk_, because there's no crosswalks on this street and people don't stop.Walk home.3:35.Tadah.You're home.Just a bit over 3.5 hours!Unfortunately, since you don't have a car, you're limited to buying what you can carry.I hope you're ready to go shopping again later this week!You have family?

Oh, well then you'll be shopping again 3 times this week. Maybe even 4 times.I hope you like waiting in the sun/rain, LA Metro only puts up cover where they can make money off advertising, so all the bus stops we've used only have benches (except one, but that one's further away).If all you needed was medication, you'll probably want to get your shopping done anyways, as this is otherwise a > 2hr trip just for that (remember, bus 2 is hourly, so you're spending an hour at the shopping center _minimum_, including walking to/from the bus stop).There's five other stores across the street from the shopping center that you'd like to check out sometime, including a new grocery store, but it takes 20 minutes to cross the shopping center, then probably another 10 to cross the street and the parking lot in front of the other stores.Add the time spent in these stores, and you've just added another hour to your shopping trip.

This is only _partially_ offset by crossing to the supermarket pharmacy, as that supermarket is nowhere near the corner, and keep on kind that anything you have to carry will slow you down more.-----Buses:- Bus 1 goes EW near home, turns NS between home and the transfer point (about 10 minutes), then goes EW again.- Bus 2 goes EW, turns NS between the shopping center and transfer point, and goes EW again.- There _was_ a bus that went NS along the east side of the shopping center (which also would have dropped me off at home, cutting out the need for a second bus entirely), but this bus route was changed in 2019 to turn away from the shopping center once it gets to the NE corner.- There's a bus that goes EW along the other side of the shopping center, but that's not helpful.-----You're forgetting about just how much convenience your car gives you _besides_ the ability to get to and from the store.- You don't have to wait for transfers or make what is effectively two trips to get somewhere.- You don't have to cross parking lots or go in and out of stores from the street (you can park up near the store, then drive to the other side of the shopping center).- You can make a quick 5 minute stop on the way home without increasing your travel time by a full hour (because the bus only comes hourly).- You don't have to wait outside.- You don't have to hope that the bus was cancelled without notification (two weeks ago I was lucky to get a ride, as my once-an-hour bus was straight up cancelled without prior warning; if I didn't use the former-official Transit app to check times, I wouldn't have known, and would have been waiting at the stop for 80 minutes like one of my less fortunate coworkers did, or taking a different once-an-hour bus home with extra transfers and lots of waiting, to only get home ~10 minutes earlier)- You don't have to only buy as much as you can carry on a single trip (I work in a grocery store, people can and do fill _multiple_ shopping carts to avoid having to go shopping a second time in a week.

People can and do purchase groceries for elderly relatives they don't live with).- if there's a detour, it only costs you the time it takes to make said detour. If the bus has to make a detour and you have tight timing, you might miss your transfer, adding 10-60 minutes to your commute.- You're not dependent someone being willing to pick you up.When I was in college, a full bus would often just go right by without stopping, since there wasn't enough room.- You're not dependent on your fellow passengers being rule-abiding or polite.Last year the bus driver stopped for an entire 50 minutes at a high school because the kids weren't being safe or quiet.

Not that they're ever quiet, or that a full bus in general is quiet, but they were throwing condoms across an overcrowded bus and yelling, and the bus driver understandably didn't want to deal with it when _he couldn't close the door_, so he stopped and said those past the yellow line on the floor needed to get off and wait for the next bus. Instead, they made fun of him, continued talking loudly, and those near the door who shoved their way into a full bus refused to move.(The next month or so was _very_ quiet on the bus)- general garbage is everywhere.The filth that people leave behind when they cram into a bus and then leave.The noise of competing music playing against each other.

Having the choice to either get up and lose your seat, or sit with someone's butt in your face because another busy bus broke down and yours is the first/closest bus going in the same direction.- All you want to do is go home and go to sleep, but you don't want to get the bus in your bed and this sweaty dude's been sitting here talking in your ear for 15 minutes now and you wish you hadn't offered him a seat, and as soon as he leaves you realize the person behind you is yelling on the phone and now you have a headache.", "Canada is about to become a 2nd world country.

That's hardly an export, especially since a lot of this knowledge was taken without our permission and in violation of laws we set out to try and avoid other people getting it.I suppose \"coming up with the idea for something\" is a good enough definition for exporting the manufacture of it, but it seems much simpler (and less egotistical) to say that \"China used our scientific discoveries to advance itself\" instead of \"we exported manufacturing to China\".", "> It is surely a great critique of the western system that China giving us stuff for free made us poorer.I mean... is it?I can think of a few times that something previously expensive is suddenly made very cheap, and there's always a class of people that really don't do that well.The closest situation I can think of is when the west was dumping food in africa [0][1].

Which made it harder for local farmers to make a living and made the food problems worse.Unless you're talking about switching to an autocratic system where the elites can turn down cheap things in exchange for the long term benefits of local production. And, in theory, China might be able to, in theory, do that.I don't know their elite culture well enough to say otherwise.

For instance, our system is not an autocracy, yet we chose to move manufacturing to China.Not every system that makes decisions is autocratic.

People could just as easily vote to do something democratically if they know it is in their own good.But consider what is really happening in these places. They have an economic system which makes decisions about the allocation of resources.In response to the addition of new resources, these systems decided to decrease production of local resources below existing levels, and hence make people poorer as a result.The issue here is purely one of distribution and management.Suppose in the trivial case of food being dumped in Africa, said food was instead sold below market rates, and the income from this was used to subsidise farms to bring their outputs to the same price as the aid.Local manufacture remains worthwhile, prices decrease, and supply increases.Everyone benefits.I don't think it should be crazy to envision an economic system stable enough to allow people to benefit when you give them things for free.

I certainly saw this happen to people I knew, one of them lived with us for awhile and my folks arranged for her to live with a relative, which allowed them to really make it in life instead of being stuck in the system. Weirdly, after some initial trouble that looked impossible to overcome, it was very simple to get them placed into our home, and, very simple to get them in with a relative.Most of that was the workings of the social worker assigned to them, who was hard to reach out to, and very clearly over worked.Basically, there has to be a better intervention than just taking people's children away, which certainly keys into your points.I'd take it further to the point where, the poverty line is re-evaluated per locality, and inflation needs to be accurately reported, and with it the tax brackets as required by law.Then we need to dump the tax burden completely off the lowest earners, along with their requirement to file taxes at all.

Then, we need to re-evaluate the bottom tiers to ramp in slowly to help eliminate welfare traps. It'd probably be a good idea, additionally, to no longer tax things like unemployment/workmen's comp/disability/social security/etc, for similar reasons.Reporting taxes itself is a burden all its own, and it negatively affects people who already struggle with math.Also, something that isn't currently done, and certainly should be done, is to create interactions between the kids who have poor situations with the kids that have good situations.My elementary school had a 'buddy' program, where the older kids would hang out in a structured way with the younger kids.I think it'd go a long way in terms of support to have a system where kids from the good side of town interact with kids from the bad side of town in that way, and to make it a K-12 program.

Frankly, though, I actually think they know these things but have perverse incentives to keep the population stratified.This country would financially crumble without the abuse of those in poverty for every one of those 7 generations, if not more.I think managing this pool of exploitable resources is actually a primary component of most govs immigration strategies.", "I'm really surprised that you consider it a \"sacrifice\" to help others.

If we can sever this great chain of injustice of which you speak, where poverty and suffering are transmitted from parent to child like a disease; aught we not take that action?

That's a government trying to get more tax income than what they are entitled to, hidden under the guise of simplification. We are equal under the law, and therefore, theoretically, we are equal under taxes.It is irrelevant that someone has, or does not have access to such a canteen, if they are not making use of the facility, the net outcome is the same, and therefore, the taxation should be the same.And then a point could be made about the relevancy of taxation in the canteen example.(Although it should not be forgotten that it was just a randomly quantified example for the sake of argument).But let's say that company A decides to provide a canteen, with food sold at cost price to its employees.This turns out to be 20% cheaper than eating in a random other canteen \"at market price\" (i.e.

charging you for cost price + company B profit).Now you are actually taxing the fact that company A decided to make the effort to setup a canteen, hire cooks/canteen employees, probably make a qualitative effort to offer better food, and not seek profit on the effort, when compared to company B, offering food at a higher price as it includes profit.Congratulations, in a context of decreasing food quality offered by catering services world-wide, your taxation approach just further de-incentivized potential quality over taxation income. Further fully disregarding the fact that to offer a catering service, company A had to make investments, is employing personnel, buying food, etc, and is, therefore, already contributing more to global tax revenues for the state.Furthermore, you are also unfairly putting non-profit catering services at a disadvantage, as, they too will be taxed more, as they are also offering their food below \"market price\".

I believe the default is that, where inertia is cancelled out automatically for easier flight.Of course, to make the game playable and fair there's a maximum speed you can achieve while not in hyperspace.", "If there is it’s completely a surprise to me and I’m now quite interested in using it.

My biggest beef with the game is how slow the ship is to turn in combat and that I can’t do strafing.", "FA Off, or Flight Assist Off, is the mode in Elite Dangerous where your ship does not correct any momentum (angular or linear) that you have, except for imposing speed limits. In this mode, you will be using 6 strafe thrusts and 6 turning controls, and it's entirely up to you to use them to cancel momentum if you want to stand still or fly in a controlled direction.It is absolutely incredible to play like this, and very hard but rewarding.It can be essential for high level combat, and there's an entire community of hooners (sp?) that fly among narrow spaces between mountains doing incredible maneuvers.They use extra things like opening the cargo hatch or landing gear as aerobrakes (lower ship speed limit).Many \"normal\" pilots will enable and disable Flight Assist situationally, mostly to gain extra turning speed during FA OFF.

It's worth searching youtube for some related videos.Unfortunately for mouse/keyboard users like me there's a couple of things in the control scheme that conspire to make it harder to use than it could be. Still, the first time I landed my Cutter (a massive ship with brutal inertia) in a rotating station with FA OFF, I felt like the king of the world.Note that you don't need FA OFF to do strafing in all directions.I do it all the time.However with FA ON, the ship will counter your strafes to correct the ship's motion into the forward/back axis.Strafes in FA OFF are more powerful and can let your ship move at top speed in any direction while facing any other direction, but you only really need that for tight flight maneuvers.", "That sounds quite a bit like decoupled mode for star citizen.

But I agree it's not as big as it could be, and that the magic hasn't really been recaptured. Game developers seem to frequently have this same thought.Descent was good!This should be more popular!Someone tries every couple years or so, but the result generally disappoints.It is my opinion that 6DOF games are difficult to make good, especially to the standards and expectations of modern gamers.The combat and level design are much more technical (or perhaps just differently technical) than someone from a flat FPS perspective expects, and as a result, the game design seems to have a lot of opportunities for technical mistakes to be made.I think more generic FPS developers, who remembered liking Descent back when our standards were lower, don't realize how much we've learned since then and how very much there is TO learn about the genre.I find that aggravating.

Every few years, the Descent community gets excited about a big 6DOF attempt, and every few years we get disappointed by the result. Even more aggravating, they generally make design mistakes that I think show ignorance of the genre.How does this keep happening?You wouldn't think of making an RTS, or a MOBA, or even a flight combat sim, or really any other very technical genre of game, without the expertise of the veterans and elite players of the genre.And yet 6DOF developers seem to me to do just that.I can only conclude that the problem looks from the outside to he easier than it really is.I don't mean to sound arrogant!What I mean is that, I think the answer to your question \"Why isn't this more of a thing?\" is that it's a much harder thing than it appears to be.

I think Descent's success can be attributed to a lot of things: to lower standards 30 years ago, to lucky or prescient design decisions, to a brilliant team enjoying the unique freedom of the wild world of 90s software passion projects, and to a lot of community involvement over time. And I'm not sure that's the whole list.I do think it should be a bigger thing now - there is a delicious flavor here and no reason this generation shouldn't love it too.But it's also apparent that Descent caught lightning in a bottle, and even I couldn't tell you everything that went into making it happen once but not twice.I can point to reasons that I think attempts to repeat it have been less successful, reasons that make sense to me as an expert player in the genre, problems I think I or a couple dozen pilots like me could help anyone avoid.But I'm not sure that explains all of the difficulty.

Every now and again, some veteran pilot will take the problem into their own hands and try to make the next big 6DOF, and those projects are rarely finished and rarely good. It doesn't seem that hard, from a software point of view, and they know the game!Or think they do.And yet they fail.So genre expertise can't be the only ingredient, even if I think it's a necessary and usually missing one.The problem is clearly harder than it looks.I think I know what to do, or at least one piece of the puzzle, but better warriors have been slain on that battlefield, and I haven't actually made the attempt, so I don't actually know.But I can definitely say this much: Developer beware!Here there be dragons!Overload's good though.:)", "Expanding on this:when you add the extra degrees of freedom in Descent-like games, relative to Quake-like games (or flight/space sims but in different ways), there are some emergent behaviors that change how the game fundamentally feels.

What frequently happens when random devs take on a 6dof project because they enjoyed Descent back in the day is they'll make a game that feels like a shooter with vertical flight, and is missing some of the key things that make Descent feel good. I've heard some 6dof games described as \"it feels like I'm flying a camera, not a ship\" (lack of turning momentum), or \"it feels sluggish when I try to move in multiple directions\" (lack of vector independence / trichording), or \"it's just spray-and-pray combat\" (undersized ship hitboxes relative to projectile speed/size and level size.) There are a lot of things we've learned over 30 years of playing Descent and Descent-like games that don't always get taken seriously by devs of other 6dof projects.

And even when they do take everything seriously, there are things none of us have figured out how to articulate but that can make a 6dof game feel bad.I think it'd be possible to build a great game in the genre, but you'd need a bunch of key things to come together, and then you'd also need great marketing to get the thing in front of millions of eyeballs to make enough sales to keep the community going.", "Hellbender on PC was a good one too", "Terminal Velocity and Fury3 before it...", "I think it's called 6dof games.", "There's a weird effect where sometimes one game in a genre will become so iconic that nobody wants to try and make another one, possibly out of fear of seeming like they're ripping it off?

It wasn’t actually that great a game.I loved it at the time but in retrospect there’s just not that much there.The most recent incarnation of a game like this is The Witness which is better in every way I can think of.For Descent it was true 3D - was it the first?It predates quake.Maybe some people were captivated by the gameplay but for me it was “holy shit it’s 3d”.There’s a reason we have tons of FPSes and only a few Descent clones; the latter just aren’t that fun for most people.", "There were tons of Myst clones that came out after.

The most prominent example was probably Rama, based on the Arthur C. Clarke novels.But lots of others like Shadow of the Obelisk, Obsidian, etc.", "There were quite a few myst like in the 90s.Lighthouse: The Dark Being is one I enjoyed as a kid.\nRheah is another one during that period.\nCryo released an entire series of Myst like with Atlantis (not great though).Mystery of the Nautilus and Return to Mysterious island are decent though.So, I'd say there were plenty of myst-like clones mostly focused on the European market though and not necessarily very successful.", "The Sims was like that too, and it's only recently that anyone's tried to launch a full-blown competitor, Life By You from Paradox, who also launched a full blown SimCity competitor, Cities: Skylines.It's run by Rob Humble, who managed The Sims 2 and 3.Myst was the top selling game of all time until The Sims came along and dethroned it for quite some time.

So you have a point about how some top selling games can become so iconic that there aren't any alternatives for a long time.I think it's a great thing that Paradox eventually picked up the ball and made some competition for SimCity and The Sims, after EA strayed from the original designs, and enshitified them with all the expansion packs and online DRM bullshit.Competition is great, and The Sims 4 and SimCity and the competing alternatives would be much better off and further along, if they only had viable competition all these years.

EA should have released and documented and supported their internal content creation and programming tools for user created content, instead of putting all their effort into competing with fans and trying to squeeze the last penny out of it with expansion packs.I've proposed and campaigned for EA to release the tools since before the release of The Sims 1 in 2000, and they did eventually give me the rights and pay me to develop and release some limited tools like The Sims Transmogrifier for The Sims 1, but they never followed through with releasing the internal tools like the Edith editor and SimAntics visual programming language, or the 3D Studio Max content creation tools, and they never officially supported or documented anything, the way Factorio and other games do such a wonderful job at.This video shows Edith -- The Sims Steering Committee - June 4 1998:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC52jE60KjYAnd this shows The Sims Transmogrifier and some other tools I developed with it, and user created content programmed by fans with the limited tools available (iffpencil2 etc) -- Demo of The Sims Transmogrifier, RugOMatic, ShowNTell, Simplifier and Slice City:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imu1v3GecB8Decades later, it's now possible but difficult to develop and program user created content for The Sims 4 in Python, but it's terribly documented and practically unsupported.

Here is the original proposal I wrote around the time we released The Sims 1 in March 2000, which outlined what we should do, but unfortunately they didn't take it nearly as far as I suggested, and never let me release the 3D Studio Max animation and object exporters, or the Edith editor and visual programming tools.https://web.archive.org/web/20040329181128/http://www.donhop...>A Proposal to Develop Third Party Content Authoring Tools for The Sims, by Don Hopkins, March 2000>This is a proposal I wrote to Maxis after The Sims was released in March 2000, outlining some of my ideas for third party content authoring tools that I could develop.

This led to The Sims Transmogrifier, but it touches on several other interesting tools and projects that Maxis never got around to.>Problem Definition:>There is a strong demand many from third parties who want to develop their own custom content for The Sims, including characters and objects.>Proposed Solution:>Update, clean up and document the content creation tools, so third parties can make their own characters and objects for The Sims.>Port the tools to the latest version of 3D Studio Max.>Make the tools self contained so they can be run stand-alone, by removing all dependencies on the Maxis environment and expensive software packages: Character Studio (Biped, Physique), Access, SourceSafe, MKS Toolkit (Korn Shell).>Document the content creation tools with an overview, examples, tutorials, and a reference manual. Write down the folklore that has been passed by word of mouth.

Read over the code and document how it actually behaves.>Provide consulting, training and content creation services to third parties who want custom content authored for The Sims, but don't want or know how to do it themselves.>Develop a Sims Content Authoring SDK, so it's possible for third parties to create specialized content creation tools, like FaceLift.>Goals:>Third Party Character Creation and Customization:>Characters include virtual people who the user can play with, as well as autonomous non-player characters with programmed behaviors.

Characters consist of bodies, heads and hands of 3D polygonal meshes with texture mapped bitmap skins.>Characters are created at Maxis by highly skilled artists using expensive tools like 3D Studio Max, Character Studio, the CMX exporter, and Photoshop.>Simplify the content creation tools and make them run stand-alone, so third party artists and designers can create their own characters and objects.>Maxis' expert 2D character artists currently use Photoshop to paint body textures in layers, then flatten and dither them into 256 color bitmap files.>\"Flesh out\" the process of applying layered clothing to naked bodies and dithering to 8 bits, so anyone can dress up their characters in all kinds of clothes.>Maxis' expert 3D modeling artists create textured low-poly rigid meshes (like heads, hands and accessories) attached to individual bones, and the CMX exporter creates rigid suits.>Make the CMX exporter easy for third parties to use, so many proficient 3D artists will be able to make their own textured heads, accessories, selected character pointers, and carried objects.>Maxis' expert 3D character modeling artists attach textured low-poly deformable meshes (like bodies) to skeletons using Character Studio Physique and Biped, and the CMX exporter reads out the weighted vertex/bone bindings and creates deformable suits for the game.>Character Studio is an expensive plug-in that enables a skilled artist to bind deformable meshes to skeletons, but there are other ways to do that with 3D Studio Max and other 3D tools.>Enhance the CMX exporter to support Max's new way of attaching deformable meshes to skeletons, so third party 3D artists can create bodies.>Maxis designers and programmers use the Edith tool to configure the behavior of characters and objects.>Clean up and document Edith, so third party designers and programmers can program and modify their own characters and objects.>Third Party Object Creation and Customization:>Objects consist of pre-rendered z-buffered sprites, packaged together with character animations, sound effects and programmed behavior.>Objects are created in-house at Maxis, by highly skilled 3D modeling artists, using lots of polygons and detailed texture maps in 3D Studio Max.

The sprite exporter breaks the objects up into tiles and renders them in different scales and rotations, then writes out z-buffered sprites.>Clean up and document the sprite exporter, so third party artists can use it with 3D Studio Max to make their own objects.>The sprite exporter is very specific to 3D Studio Max, especially when breaking apart multi-tile objects.>Maxis' expert 3D character animation artists create skeletons and animations of characters interacting with objects.

They use Character Studio Biped, although the exporter supports other types of skeletons, like the bones built into Max or even hierarchies of normal objects.>Clean up and document the CMX exporter, so third party character animators can use it with 3D Studio Max with or without Character Studio to make their own character animations.>Enable Third Party Content Creation Tool Development:>Develop and document an SDK (Software Development Kit) that gives third parties the information they need to make their own content creation tools for The Sims.>Enable and encourage the development of tools like FaceLift and Blueprint by third parties.>A \"BodyLift\" tool that enables anyone to mutate, breed and tweak deformable body meshes, like FaceLift lets anyone do with rigid head meshes.>A skin tool that enables anyone to layer clothes and accessories on different bodies, skin colors, sexes, ages, etc.

Allow artists to create 32 bit alpha masked layers of clothing that can be applied to any body.>An animation tool that enables anyone to create their own dance sequences, walk loops and idle animations, by mixing, cross fading and mutating between many pre-existing dramatic poses, dance moves, walks and idle loops.>Specialized object creation tools that enable anyone create their own customized objects from templates, like a PictureFramer that would create a framed picture from any bitmap, or a JukeboxFactory that would create a jukebox full of your favorite mp3 files.", "Forsaken.

My dad couldn't get it to work, and so the box sat on the shelf for months, maybe even a year. (Time's warped when you're a young kid.=P ) I'd leaf through the manual and gaze longingly at the box art, and look through the little technical leaflets that were included.The latter of which may have been written in hieroglyphs.I set it aside, played the Descent demo over and over that came with out PC, and surfed AOL.I kept learning more about the computer in the meantime.One day I was performing my old ritual, when I noticed one of the paper leaflets in the box.Rather than being hieroglyphs, I knew now what it was saying.X-Wing needed DOS EMS (Expanded memory), and this paper was telling me I needed to edit CONFIG.SYS on Windows 95 machines to get this to work.

My parents had forbid me from touching anything in the \"WINDOWS\" folder (there be dragons, according to them) and after having wiped a lot of my mom's files on our earlier Tandy, they didn't want me messing with things I didn't understand that they couldn't fix.But I was confidant. I edited the file, and hoped for the best.The computer restarted, and just as I'd done countless times before to no avail, tried to start up the game.Listening to the Star Wars theme play MIDI over the speakers, I jumped up, ecstatic.It was late at night, and my parents were watching TV in the living room.I ran downstairs.\"I GOT X-WING WORKING!!!!!!\"It was a feeling of accomplishment, that to this day I look back on and say \"that's when it started\".I think I knew it then, to some tiny degree, that this was going to be my path.I'm 40 now.I'm a solutions architect at AWS.My computers were all built by me.

There's not much to figure out.I don't blame them; I don't shake my fist at these kids.After all, I recall the frustrations too.Building PCs that wouldn't start for no reason (well, this still happens), the unreliability of early home routers.Many early games that just wouldn't start on your PC but run just fine on your buddies.I remember LAN parties with my colleagues with a combined technical know-how in the room of several CCNAs, MCSEs, etc, and we still can't get our Unreal Tournament server to be seen by everyone's PC.Don't get me started on copy protection woes.But there was a joy in finally getting it working, and through the stress, we learned a lot about how it all worked.

The current internet and computer environment doesn't have that in that you need to know how it works in order to enjoy it. I wouldn't reverse the state of affairs; things are much more mature and stable now.And it's not as simple as saying \"well go off and do these projects\".We can motivate some to do so as a stretch, but nothing was motivating the same way as sheer necessity like we had it.So I see it as just something to observe and note and appreciate for how we had it then, both maddeningly frustrating yet glorious in how genuine and unrefined it all was.Hopefully later generations will find their own versions of what we experienced.I'm glad to have lived through it.It kick-started a love of computing and a lifelong career.", "Some friends of mine played Descent competitively, and I was amazed to learn about so-called trichording: to maximize your speed, you need to press multiple keys at the same time to travel along all 3 axes at once, e.g.forward/right/up.

So people learned to pulsate it multiple times per second so that it would recharge between the fraction-of-a-second uses and keep at ~95% all the time instead of quickly dropping to low figures.So if you wanted to go really fast you'd both run diagonally in three dimensions and keep pulsating the afterburner multiple times per second.", "It wasn't really considered either a bug or a feature by the original designers, it was just not something they put any thought into.

My wife and I tried some alternatives (by modding D1) and flew a demo for Mike/Matt/Luke/Dan and whoever else was in the studio that day, and eventually settled on \"vector independence just feels good\" which is why Overload has the ability to change from a normalized flight mode with faster 1D flight into the trichording mode.", "In the competitive ladders some of the best used rotation to \"steer\" in curved paths when trichording.It made people really difficult to hit when you were behind them.I played against some ladder players and was amazed at their other order of magnitude skill.Part of the reason those og games were so compelling to me is because they didn't really have a skill cap.It would have been amazing to watch some of those matches in a streaming platform.", "In 2D, the diagonal across a 1x1 rectangle is longer than just its sides.A naive implementation of just adding the x and y vectors together will become their sum, totaling up to the diagonal length, 1.41x faster.

The CRS is somewhat paranoia inducing if you don't have great infrastructure setup with the right tools to carry that metadata with your geospatial data.I've tested everything AWS has to offer, Postgres/PostGIS, Spark/DB, Snowflake, Trini, and ARCGis.I'm convinced the best tool for large scale geospatial work is Google BigQuery and it's not even close.

You'll eventually want that index - but it's best created after ingestion in a one-shot load like this.I'd also be interested in how the HDD you're reading data from is holding up in some of the highly parallel setups?", "Thank you for reading and for your kind words!Ah I did not know about the `create_default_indexes=>false` and that a time index is created by default for hypertables. I'll add a note to explain this!Also curious to benchmark inserting without the time index then creating it manually.Even with 32 workers I think the HDD was fine.I did monitor disk usage through btop and the SSD that Postgres lived on seemed to be more of a bottleneck than the HDD.So my conclusion was that a faster SSD for Postgres would be a better investment than moving the data from HDD to SSD.", "Great post!Hi Ali!I think what's missing here is an analysis of what is gained by moving the weather data into a RDBMS.The motivation is to speed up queries.

But what's the baseline?As someone very familiar with this tech landscape (maintainer of Xarray and Zarr, founder of https://earthmover.io/), I know that serverless solutions + object storage can deliver very low latency performance (sub second) for timeseries queries on weather data--much faster than the 30 minutes cited here--_if_ the data are chunked appropriately in Zarr. Given the difficulty of data ingestion described in this post, it's worth seriously evaluating those solutions before going down the RDBMS path.", "Hey Ryan and thank you for the feedback!I agree that storing the data is appropriately chunked Zarr files is almost surely going to be faster, simpler to set up, and take up less space.Could even put up an API in front of it to get \"queries\".I also agree that I haven't motivated the RDBMS approach much.

This is mainly because I took this approach with Postgres + Timescale since I wanted to learn to work with them, and playing around with ERA5 data seemed like the most fun way. Maybe it's the allure of weather data being big enough to pose a challenge here.I don't have anything to back this up but I wonder if the RDBMS approach, with properly tuned and indexed TimescaleDB + PostGIS (non-trivial to set up), can speed up complex spatio-temporal queries, e.g.computing the 99th percentile of summer temperatures in Chile from 1940-1980, in case many different Zarr chunks have to be read to find this data.

I like the idea of setting up different tables to cache these kinds of statistics, but it's not that hard to do with Zarr either.I'm benchmarking queries and indexes next so I might know more then!", "This is a bit off-topic but I'm interested in the same space you are in.There seems to be an inherent pull between large chunks (great for visualising large extents and larger queries) vs smaller chunks for point-based or timeseries queries. It's possible but not very cost-effective to maintain separately-chunked versions of these large geospatial datasets.I have heard of \"kerchunk\" being used to try and get the best of both, but then I _think_ you lose out on the option of compressing the data and it introduces quite a lot of complexity.What are your thoughts on how to strike that balance between use cases?", "> It's possible but not very cost-effective to maintain separately-chunked versions of these large geospatial datasets.Like all things in tech, it's about tradeoffs.

S3 storage costs about $275 TB a year. Typical weather datasets are ~10 TB.If you're running a business that uses weather data in operations to make money, you could easily afford to make 2-3 copies that are optimized for different query patterns.We see many teams doing this today in production.That's still much cheaper (and more flexible) than putting the same volume of data in a RDBMS, given the relative cost of S3 vs.persistent disks.The real hidden costs of all of these solutions is the developer time operating the data pipelines for the transformation.", "That's a great point, it really is all about tradeoffs.In my use case there is strong motivation to keep data creation times low, so writing out multiple datasets comes at a product/opportunity cost moreso than a storage cost.Thanks for the insight.", "Why?Most weather and climate datasets - including ERA5 - are highly structured on regular latitude-longitude grids.

Even if you were solely doing timeseries analyses for specific locations plucked from this grid, the strength of this sort of dataset is its intrinsic spatiotemporal structure and context, and it makes very little sense to completely destroy the dataset's structure unless you were solely and exclusively to extract point timeseries. And even then, you'd probably want to decimate the data pretty dramatically, since there is very little use case for, say, a point timeseries of surface temperature in the middle of the ocean!The vast majority of research and operational applications of datasets like ERA5 are probably better suited by leveraging cloud-optimized replicas of the original dataset, such as ARCO-ERA5 published on the Google Public Datasets program [1].These versions of the dataset preserve the original structure, and chunk it in ways that are amenable to massively parallel access via cloud storage.

In almost any case I've encountered in my career, a generically chunked Zarr-based archive of a dataset like this will be more than performant enough for the majority of use cases that one might care about.[1]: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-datasets/era5", "The main reason why was that it's a personal project and I wanted to do everything on my home server so that I wouldn't have to pay for cloud resources, and so that I could learn Postgres, TimescaleDB, and eventuallly PostGIS.But as rabernat pointed out in his comment, pulling out a long time series from the cloud replica is also slow. And I know I eventually want to perform complex spatio-temporal queries, e.g.computing the 99% percentile of summer temperatures in Chile from 1940-1980.I don't doubt that a cloud replica can be faster, but it's at odds with my budget of $0 haha.", "I too need to do percentiles.One option is loop through the grids but bin/histogram it.

Crash, clean up the right edge of the loaded data, start back up.Here's the full set of postgresql.conf settings I run to disable the WAL and other overhead:wal_level = minimal\n max_wal_senders = 0\n synchronous_commit = off\n fsync = off\n full_page_writes = off\n autovacuum = off\n checkpoint_timeout = 60minFinally, when loading in big chunks, to keep the vacuum work down I'd normally turn off autovac as above then issue periodic VACUUM FREEZE commands running behind the currently loading date partition.

Segments of high resolution, low noise data (satellites) are mixed with low resolution, low coverage, high noise records (hand records on a boat made surrounding the united kingdom).My point is to be in awe of the technical aspects of this effort but also keep in mind that we are only making copies of low resolution, noisy manuscripts from sailors 170 years ago.", "ERA5 covers 1940 to present.

It's certainly less visible on the peaks in the low, because maybe the absolute lowest scores appear to be in the 1990-2000 decade, but then again, all years in the 2010-2020 decade seem to be slightly higher than the minimum temperature in any other decade.That said, there is massive downscaling involved in such scale, so I wouldn't be too surprised if some details were just skipped and not visible. I wouldn't trust this interpretation much - if a visualization it needs to be, I'd rather plot a moving average with a window of 6 months at least (or even 1 year to entirely rule seasonalities out), and see if that one has an upward trend or not (I bet it does).[EDIT] I now see the post below with the year averages since 1979.It does indeed seem that 1995-1997 were abnormally cold years, and also that 2010-2020 is the warmest decade since then (and likely since quite a bit longer).

So even the thread was preemptive, and thus particularly threatening, it was nicer to write the program.Also, if you multiplex events onto a single thread, though you get some better guarantees about execution order than you do under preemptive threads, it is still chaotic. Events arrive in any order.Multiple state machines update their state in any order, and hit their important states in any order.Data being chopped into frames arbitrarily scrambles things.The past million time the program read four bytes from the network socket, it got the entire 32 bit integer in one operation.Today, it didn't notice that the read only returned 3 bytes.Threads are exciting, especially to young programmers.Look, all you have to do is write little programs that do simple things in a loop, taking some messages here and replying there.Put them together, and the complex behavior of the application will somehow just emerge, as if by magic.

There's an impedance mismatch when you have both multiple threads and something that involves callback/async logic.I just discovered that the Rust graphics stack of Rend3/WGPU/Vulkan/GPU has this problem.The goal is that you're busy rendering the scene in one thread, and in other threads you're loading assets into the GPU for stuff you're going to be near soon as you walk or drive around the scene.Down at the Vulkan/GPU level, the model is that you put commands on a command queue, and you get completions back, not necessarily in order.

You can have more than one command queue, and the usual setup is a \"graphics\" queue, which can ask for anything the GPU can do, and a \"transfer\" queue, which can only move data from CPU memory to GPU memory.On top of this, there's a constraint that, while adding a command to a queue is cheap, \"submitting\" a queue and starting it up is expensive. So having only one command on the queue per asset-loading thread is apparently inefficient.This means that you have to reply to transfer requests with something like a future, one that blocks when you actually need the data.Other than the Unreal Engine people, nobody seems to actually implement all this.

Require each ticket to be associated with a real person's name at the time of purchase (and the ticketing platform should make it easier for people to find tickets next to or at least near their friends when they have to buy in separate orders).Tickets aren't transferable. Ticket purchasing platform has a marketplace where people can resell tickets to others if they can't attend, and sale price is capped at whatever they paid in the first place.(Or the ticket issuers can partner with something that already exists, like StubHub, and contractually require the price caps.)Each attendee must present their ID to enter the event.Names must match, no exceptions.I don't love the idea that you can't anonymously attend a concert (by walking up to the ticket counter and paying in cash, assuming any large venues even have box offices anymore), but I think the benefits of this scheme for the majority of purchasers far outweigh that negative.This isn't hard.

If fans didn't pay the high prices, the prices would drop.Your comment (the word fleece) suggests you are at least somewhat judgmental about \"greed\": this type of judgment is why bands try to pretend that they sell the tickets for a \"fair\" price, and that's what creates the 2ndary market, and that's what creates the kickbacks and the need for a scapegoat.you expect to pay a high price for a Picasso at auction.

So yes, I would expect that relative to verticals where things require actual ingenuity or skill to do a good job, it would be easy for people who operate venues to either just roll their own ticketing systems, or contract with dozens of vendors who would compete on their value.Of course, venue owners who are not themselves part of Live Naton itself could do this today, but the gross agreements where ticketmaster inflates fees and splits them with everybody in order to gain an exclusivity contract makes this uncommon.The whole thing is so corrupt and greedy it's sickening.", "And if you disbelieve this or want to see proof, check out Live Nations 10-k from 2015.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1335258/000133525816...\"Ticketing.

Our Ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of our clients and retains a fee, or “service charge”, for these services. We sell tickets for our events and also for third-party clients across multiple live event categories, providing ticketing services for leading arenas, stadiums, amphitheaters, music clubs, concert promoters, professional sports franchises and leagues, college sports teams, performing arts venues, museums and theaters.We sell tickets through websites, mobile apps, ticket outlets and telephone call centers.During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold 69%, 21%, 7% and 3% of primary tickets through these channels, respectively.Our Ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and bundled product offerings.During 2015, our Ticketing business generated approximately $1.6 billion, or 22.6%, of our total revenue, which excludes the face value of tickets sold.

Through all of our ticketing services, we sold 160 million tickets in 2015 on which we were paid fees for our services. In addition, approximately 297 million tickets in total were sold using our Ticketmaster systems, through season seat packages and our venue clients’ box offices, for which we do not receive a fee.Our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public, which may vary depending upon event scheduling by our clients.As ticket sales increase, related ticketing operating income generally increases as well.\"$1.6b of revenue selling 297m tickets.$5.79 per ticket.So you are paying $20 fees on a ticket, who do you think gets that money if it isn't Ticketmaster?", "Well something is going on.

This is harder if you're very new to a language and don't have a live teacher present, but at some point it probably switches to being a benefit for many or most learners.The German teachers also encouraged students to try to explain vocabulary (to each other) in German, on one occasion literally having us play the game Taboo (in which you have to get people to guess a word without saying that word or a few closely thematically related terms).As an example from your site, when I tried it out with EN→PT, I encountered the defined word \"joelho\" 'knee' (which I already knew), and the definition used \"coxa\" 'thigh' which I had encountered in the past but mostly forgotten. It was helpful to me to see the Portuguese definition and possibly less helpful to see the English definition (because relying on it would have been a missed opportunity to refresh my knowledge of \"coxa\").

Overall, european portuguese is more formal, and brazilian, more casual.", "Other differences that stood out to me in visiting Lisbon and the Azores:(1) European Portuguese usually fully preserves \"tu\" (including distinctive verb forms), while in Brazilian Portuguese, it's often only used in oblique forms \"te\" and \"ti\", or regionally as a subject but often with the third person verb form. For example, in much of Brazil you would see \"você tem\" (even when speaking to a close friend or family member); in some parts of Brazil, like in Rio Grande do Sul, you would see \"tu tem\"; and in Portugal you might see \"tu tens\".(2) European Portuguese uses \"a\" + infinitive where Brazilian Portuguese uses the present participle: \"estou a fazer\" versus \"estou fazendo\", or \"está a falar\" versus \"está falando\".This distinction is very strong and consistent.(3) Pronunciation can be very different.

The first thing you would notice is that the <d> before <e> and <i> is not pronounced as /dʒ/ and the <t> before those letters is not pronounced as /tʃ/. So for example <diabo> 'devil' or <diagonal> 'diagonal' start with /dʒ/ in Brazil but with /d/ in Europe, or <sede> 'thirst' ends with /dʒi/ in Brazil but /dɨ/ in Europe.Or especially the adjective ending <-mente> will be /'mẽtʃi/ in Brazil but /'mẽtɨ/ in Europe.The word-final vowels in European Portuguese often seem to get dropped entirely (or to be pronounced very softly or briefly), so you might even hear that adverb ending as /mẽt/ (approaching French!!).I found it fairly challenging as a non-native speaker.", "The pronunciation is different inside Brazil, like some NY accents versus standard american english for instance, or when I try to follow someone from Texas versus someone from New Zealand.All your points are correct!

My understanding is an underage teen who takes a nude selfie and sends it can be charged with distributing \"child porn.\" This is a serious problem and should not be true.If other people forward it, they should be charged, but a teenager should not get in legal trouble for making a nude selfie and sending it privately.B.We need to culturally get over a lot of our hangups about certain things.His girlfriend was attending church.The church should be telling kids \"This is not worth killing yourself over.\"C.

We somehow need to come up with reasonable accommodation for the reality that teens have phones and budding sexualities and these two things are colliding horrifically in a legal and cultural system strongly rooted in assuming \"child porn\" is made solely by abusive adults and not willingly by underage teens who don't think it's a big deal at the time the photo is snapped.Taking a nude selfie should be safer than baring your body in person. No risk of STDs or pregnancy are involved.And yet we've turned it into this hugely dangerous thing for anyone who hasn't spent years thinking about sexual morality who isn't prepared to say to law enforcement and the world \"Nudes of me?

Big fucking deal.\"No idea how to further any of those things, but this is hardly the first article I've read about teen selfies being involved in extreme levels of harsh consequences that I just think morally should not happen and I think have roots in cultural and legal stuff going bad places in part because we aren't keeping up with the times.", "> C.

It's like the difference between saying \"you shouldn't have sex until you are a responsible adult\" vs \"I honestly don't recommend that you have sex at this age, but if you do, here's how to do it safely and responsibly\".Teaching kids \"don't send naked pictures of yourself to other people\" is one thing, but if they look around and see their peers sext with each other with no real repercussions, this warning will fall on deaf ears.

They will file it next to \"don't drink until you're 21\".On the other hand, if you start tailoring this message into something like, \"sexting is a bad idea, don't do it, especially if you don't know the other person or don't trust them 100%; if you do sext, here's how to minimize the impact of cyberbullying or blackmail: ...\", then people will loudly complain that schools are teaching their children how to sext.", "I was thinking more about our legal system and general culture needing to keep up with the times.I homeschooled my kids, so school-based sex education doesn't really make my radar.", "I think the people calling sex education \"grooming\" are the same preventing the legal system to evolve in the way you described.

two memories which I think were from age 2, but before age 3.But I cannot determine if I was three or four at the time, instead of two. I cannot determine if they were real or a dream (because they are memories of an event of such non-significance[1] that no one else remembered).I also cannot determine if they were not real and not a dream!

I cannot tell if I \"remember\" them purely because when I was older my mum used to talk about the place they lived in when I was born, and with all the details, 6yo me simply interleaved actual facts with something my mind made up so that my made up memory is consistent with the facts I heard.So, yeah, very skeptical when people tell me they can remember being two, because the odds are very much against it, and I say this as someone who has \"memories\" from 2yo, and I don't believe that those memories are, in fact, the memories of a 2yo me.Not even a little bit.[1] Memory #1: being taken to the bathroom one morning by an aunt who sometimes lived with us (and so babysat me quite often and would have done this quite often).

I only have a memory of it happening once though, even though it must have happened at least a hundred times.Memory #2: Looking at a patch of grass with a path that lead to the landlords house (also on same property, I was told when older).With either of these, I can't be sure if I was 1, 2, 3 or 4 years old at the time. I also cannot tell if either was a dream, and if it was, was it a dream I had at 6yo, dreaming about being 2 yo or was it a dream I had when 2yo?", "One of my earliest vivid memories is specifically of my 2nd birthday party, so I'm confident I wasn't actually 3 or 4.I might not quite have been 2, or I might have been a few days older than 2, but I can pinpoint my age within a couple weeks on either side.

I remember details other people didn't notice or care about, like my disappointment that the teal color of the frosting on my cake was only on the surface, not all the way through (which I discovered by shoving my hands into it), and that the water was too hot when my grandma took me to wash the frosting off my hands. I remember it the same way I remember anything else.It's probable I encoded my memories verbally much earlier than most children, though.My mom made a list in my baby book of the hundred words I could use correctly on my first birthday, and I was conversational and fluent well before my second.The theory that \"childhood amnesia\" happens because we start encoding memories verbally and forget how to access the nonverbal ones would track with my experience.I just encoded mine verbally much earlier than most children.Most people do not have memories of being two.

Is there really anything which is \"certain\" when it comes to memories?I'm not a memory expert, but as I recently read a book on the subject I think I have better than average understanding of it. If you can read Swedish or Finnish I do recommend it, the title is \"Minnets Makt\" by Julia Korkman (freely translated \"The power of memory\", official title is \"Memory Dependent\")[1].The book taught me a lot about how memories work, how they are formed, recalled and modified during the years.And as memories are a core part of everyone's life, I think it would be good for more people to understand them better.I did find a youtube video where the author, does a short lecture meant for law enforcement to teach them the basics of how memories work.

My wife spotted a man about 30 meters ahead of us who had just started drowning.I raced over and grabbed his arm.He was a very built guy and complained his muscle had cramped.He was exhausted from fighting the water and terrified.I sat next to him for a while and he held me while he recovered.No one else was around and we had only just rounded a corner to see him.I swim a lot with my kids (6 and 8).Both can swim well and dive to the bottom of a 10 ft pool.Even still, I always watch them.", "I had an almost the exact same experience, couldn't flip back up after rolling over, and first time whitewater kayaking, rocks hitting my head, etc.However, my feelings about the event afterwards were completely different.I was in a state of complete euphoria for more than a week.Watching, listening, interacting with anything brought me joy.

In DSA, if you're working with a 521-bit modulus, and you need a random k value for it, k needs to be random across all 521-bits.Systems programming intuition tells you that a 512-bit random number is, to within mind-boggling tolerances, as unguessable as a 521-bit random number.But that's not the point.A 512 bit modulus leaves 9 zero bits, which are legible to cryptanalysis as bias.

In the DSA/ECDSA equation, this reduces through linear algebra to the Hidden Number Problem, solvable over some number of sample signatures for the private key using CVP.LaterHere you go, from Sean Devlin's Cryptopals Set 8:https://cryptopals.com/sets/8/challenges/62.txt", "What's really interesting to me is that there was a known solution to the DSA/ECDSA nonce generation problem, RFC 6979, which was published 4 years before the vulnerability was introduced into PuTTY.

And it sounds like the developer knew about this RFC at the time but didn't implement it because the much earlier version of deterministic nonce generation that PuTTY already had seemed similar enough and the differences were assessed to not be security critical.So I think the other lesson here is that deviating from a cryptographic right answer is a major footgun unless you understand exactly why the recommendation works the way it does and exactly what the implications are of you doing it differently.", "The article addresses this: they wrote this code path in 2001. RFC 6979 was authored in 2013.", "But elliptic curve support and this vulnerability weren't introduced until 2017, and the commit log (https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=c...) makes it clear the developer was aware of the RFC but chose not to upgrade the 2001 code.

Doing so prior to the elliptic curve support being added would have completely avoided this vulnerability.", "In a parallel universe, they switched to RFC6979 in 2013, but the implementation had a bug that wasn't detected for years, allowing compromise of lots of keys. In that parallel universe, HN is criticizing them for following fashion instead of just leaving an already-proven piece of crypto code in place.It's an unfortunate bug, an unfortunate oversight, but I think they made a perfectly reasonable choice at the time.", "I think 6979 is a bit of a red herring here.6979 is about deterministic nonce generation, which is what you do to dodge the problem of having an insecure RNG.But the problem here isn't that the RNG is secure; it's more fundamentally a problem of not understanding what the rules of the nonce are.But I may be hair-splitting.Like, yeah, they freelanced their own deterministic nonce generation.

Either way, I think this code long predates 6979.", "I was going based off the commit link posted further down the thread (https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=c...). You're right that the PuTTY deterministic nonce generating code does appear to significantly predate the RFC, but it sounds like the developer made a conscious decision when 6979 came out not to switch from what PuTTY already had because they looked similar enough.The PuTTY release that introduced support for elliptic curve cryptography (and introduced this vulnerability) was 0.68, which came out in 2017, 4 years after the RFC.You're right that this was not an RNG security problem and instead was a problem with not understanding ECDSA nonce rules.

However the notable fact for me was that the developer was apparently aware of the recommended way to deterministically generate nonces prior to the vulnerability being introduced and made a choice not to implement the RFC because what PuTTY was already doing seemed close enough, without fully understanding the implications of doing so. To put it another way, understanding ECDSA nonce rules would have avoided this vulnerability, but so too would implementing the RFC recommended way even if the developer did not fully understand why it was better than the existing implementation.", "Right, the reason I'm splitting hairs is that in my intuition, the whole rationale for 6979 is to eliminate the possibility of fully repeated nonces, for instance because your RNG is \"unseeded\".You can still end up with a biased nonce even if you're using a perfectly seeded random bit generator (as you can see here).

But yeah I think we understand each other.As you can probably see, I just love this bug class, is all.", "RFC6979 attempts to guarantee that the nonce is unbiased (under the assumption that HMAC's output is indistinguishable from random). It's definitely attempting to give a stronger property than simply preventing a repeated nonce.See step (h) in Section 3.2.The nonce is selected by rejection sampling.Thus, under the above assumption about HMAC, the result is indistinguishable from uniformly random in the [1, q-1] range.", "> As you can probably see, I just love this bug class, is all.I agree!

DSA nonce issues are a great class of cryptographic bug in that they're sort of weirdly unexpected failure properties when you first hear about it.", "And then you find out about special soundness and that this is not only expected behaviour, but crucial to the security definitions and you realise that signatures are absolutely cursed.", "I don't think anybody consciously looked at 9 zero bits and thought this is fine, but it rather looks like unfortunate effect of plugging old code into new algorithms without proper verification.", "You could be right.

If you look at the old code, dsa_gen_k(), that was removed during the commit (https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=c...), it does basically no bounds checking, presumably because at the time it was written it was assumed that all modulus values would be many fewer bits than the size of a SHA-512 output.So it would have been pretty easy to just reuse the function for a modulus value that was too big without encountering any errors. And the old code was written 15+ years before it was used for P-521, so it's entirely possible the developer forgot the limitations of the dsa_gen_k() function.So maybe there's another lesson here about bounds checking inputs and outputs even if they don't apply to anything you're currently doing.", "I mean, bounds checking should really be caught by complete test coverage, shouldn't it?Or fuzzing?

You could wrap the FUSE client in some basic logic that detects newer torrents on the server and reloads/remounts.Many moons ago I created a Linux distribution for a bank.It was based on Ubuntu NetBoot with minimal packages for their branch desktop.As the branches were serverless, the distro was self-seeding.You could walk into a building with one of them and use it to build hundreds of clones in a pretty short time.All you needed was wake-on-lan and PXE configured on the switches.The new clones could also act as seeds.Under the hood it served a custom Ubuntu repo on nginx and ran tftp/inetd and wackamole (which used libspread, neither have been maintained for years).Once a machine got built, it pulled a torrent off the \"server\" and added it to transmission.

Once that was completed the machine could also act as a seed, so it would start up wackamole, inetd, nginx, tracker etc. At first you seed 10 machines reliably, but once they were all up, you could wake machines in greater numbers.Across hundreds of bank branches I deployed the image onto 8000 machines in a few weeks (most of the delays due to change control and staged rollout plan).Actually the hardest part was getting the first seed downloaded to the branches via their old Linux build, and using one of them to act as a seed machine.That was done in 350+ branches, over inadequate network connections (some were 256kbps ISDN)", "This may interest you, although as far as I know only AWS's S3 implements it: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjec...I actually have never used it in order to know if AWS puts their own trackers in the resulting .torrent or what", "hmmm, pretty cool.

Oso CTO here.Definitely one of my favourite problems too!Some additional context for those who don't think about this all the time: in many cases, the solution is as simple as \"write some SQL where clauses to do the filtering I care about\".e.g.I suspect the vast majority of people have logic like `where tenant_id = ?` or similar and they pass in a tenant ID on every query.Where things get challenging is when you want to decouple the logic (e.g.have an abstraction in your code, or centralize logic in a service).

Because then you're in the world of what's the decoupled API that allows me to filter my database.The easiest way to do that is just generate return a big list of IDs the user can see, and put `id in (... list of ids)` on the query.But that involves (a) syncing the data to the central service and (b) that list can get pretty long.And so that's why you would even need to think about turning rules into WHERE clauses in the first place :)", "> efficiently return a list of things that the current user has permission to accessI've done this with out-of-the-box Keycloak Authorization Services.There is an entire standards based framework for authorization piggy-backed on OAUTH called UMA2.Keycloak provides an implementation of this.It's young and the documentation is a bit thin, and the learning curve is cliff shaped, but it does what is says on the tin.My case involved authorizing verbs on a set of resources.

The backend generates a permission ticket with an arbitrary list of resources and scopes and obtains (from Keycloak) an otherwise ordinary OAUTH access token containing a UMA2 RPT (Requesting Party Token) claim. That is cycled through the \"token introspection\" endpoint of Keycloak which returns a clean, simple JSON response with the subset of resources and scopes that are authorized.Net result is two requests for any arbitrary subset of resources and scopes.Nothing is stored or managed by the backend system: all the authorization stuff is in Keycloak.You can submit an open ended request that just dumps everything the user is authorized for.It's simple enough that, foregoing signature checks that are otherwise performed, I prototype and test this stuff using shell scripts, curl and jq.

Since it's all piggy-backed on the existing OAUTH system there is no additional infrastructure.", "Tailscale's ACLs (attach users to groups, attach objects to groups, cross link the two in policies) does a bit of indirection to reduce that volume.e.g.: many objects <-> object tag <-> policy <-> user group attachments <-> user", "> A team I worked with in the past came to the same conclusion - turning authorization rules into WHERE clauses is a very efficient way to solve this problem, if you can figure out a clean way to do it.For rails specifically, https://github.com/polleverywhere/moat was built with this in mind.

There may be a plethora of environmental factors I want to evaluate in my rule. The two obvious options are:1) build the rules programmatically, based on what you observe in the request context.This works fine until you want users to be able to create and assign custom policies and load them from a database.2) put placeholders in the rule’s conditions, and swap them with the current contextual values when rehydrating the rules for a given request.Fine, except this obviates caching except for the raw rule from a database, and rehydrating dozens or hundreds of rules for every request starts to add up in terms of overhead.I wish rule conditions could reference a “context” parameter (name not important) so I could create a condition like {userId: context.user.id} and at runtime I could pass the current context when I call can.That way I can rehydrate the rule once.

I realize this creates all sorts of complications with serializing a rule to be stored in a database or sent over the wire, but that’s where some special placeholders could be understood natively by an Ability and hooked into a passed in context. However, that still creates an issue if I want to create a condition that is purely based on context ( e.g.{context.user.isTrialUser: false} )The other thing I have been struggling with is that can with a subject name only (rather than an instance) will match a rule with no conditions along with rules that have matching conditions.I understand the author’s rationalization, but can potentially create unexpected results particularly when you offer a system that lets users build their own policies.The last issue is CASL is nodejs only and I may need to support multiple platforms.

I’ve looked at Casbin because of its multiplatform support and customizable model, but I’ve found it extraordinarily hard to use beyond simple RBAC or claims-based authorization, and it still doesn’t offer solutions like conditions-to-query filters or field-level authorizations.", "Thanks for the extensive comment.

For example, when a new employee is hired, there is often a complex and time-consuming administrative process of getting their roles and permissions set up for their position, and when they change positions, teams, or leave the company, access control changes must be propagated based on these events.With something like Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), the authorization system controls access to objects by evaluating rules against the attributes of both subject (the entity requesting access) and object (the entity to be accessed).This can adapt dynamically determine access based on situational aspects: i.e. in an emergency situation, a subject may be granted access when it would be denied under normal conditions.If you've ever been in a situation when there's a problem in production and the only person who can fix it is unavailable, or can't get access, ABAC can be programmed to allow, temporarily, a backup access path.See e.g.

That's the approach we've taken with Topaz [1].Funny timing - a few days ago we published a blog post on that very topic! [2][0] https://openpolicyagent.org[1] https://topaz.sh[2] https://www.aserto.com/blog/how-rebac-helps-solve-data-filte...", "Hey all!I'm Sam, cofounder + CTO at Oso.Thank you all for the great discussions going on here.If folks are interested in either learning more about the product or working on these kinds of problems, you can email me directly at sam [at] osohq.com.", "Kinda sounds like OPA (Open Policy Agent) [1], but a different implementation.[1] https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/", "> Suppose you decide to add teams to gitcloud, so different teams in an organization can have different permissions.Will you be able to find all the functions and queries you need to modify in order to make teams work properly?Do you want to have to do that?\n> This is why we introduced Polar, our declarative DSL for authorization.

Polar allows you to separate your authorization logic from your application logic and express it in a language that is purpose built for authorization. A simple Polar policy looks something like this:First, I appreciate that it is the Polar \"programming language\" and not yet another kind of stupid YAML DSL.However: you seem to target developers.Why do you force me to leave my IDE and use your \"rules editor\"?Can I not write all those things in my IDE, with all the support it brings, and integrate this into my CICD flow?(yes, there is the .polar file, but why force me to jump through hoops?)Then, why did you create a new DSL and not a merely a (de-)serializable datastructure (which will indeed look like a dsl)?One, that is powerful enough to represent the capabilities you need.

Then, I could in fact use any language (library) of my choice and create the rules from this language, which just has to create the datastructure.Or, backwards: why do you think authorization is so special that it deserves a custom language? Is it more special than performance-testing, logging, auditing, debugging, metrics and so on?Apart from that, I really like the `yes, if` idea!Would be nice to hear a bit more about that (unfortunately, the article pretty much ends there).Such as: how to deal with actions that change things and can (or must) potentially be run before the authorization is completed and such.", "> However: you seem to target developers.Why do you force me to leave my IDE and use your \"rules editor\"?Can I not write all those things in my IDE, with all the support it brings, and integrate this into my CICD flow?(yes, there is the .polar file, but why force me to jump through hoops?)Hey valenterry!Oso CTO here.

You can absolutely write policies locally and integrate this with CI/CD.

Would be nice to hear a bit more about that (unfortunately, the article pretty much ends there).Such as: how to deal with actions that change things and can (or must) potentially be run before the authorization is completed and such.We typically recommend authorizing in two places: at the start of a request, and then when fetching data.e.g.in our demo app, authorizing \"can a user create an issue\" involves authorizing a \"create_issue\" action against the repository itself: https://github.com/osohq/gitcloud/blob/sam/list-filtering/se...Whereas anything listing issues calls the `list_local` method and does the `yes, if` style approach.", "> We have a post on this coming soon!

And logic languages are a particularly good fit for representing the branching conditional logic you often see in authorization configurations.Ha, I've been playing around with Biscuits (https://www.biscuitsec.org/) and was writing up a blog post on using them in a git forge.When I saw the Polar data units described as \"facts\" and read your end to end example (https://www.osohq.com/docs/tutorials/end-to-end-example) I thought \"Oh this looks very similar\".I will say - I do like how Polar seems to type stuff and provide some concepts that Biscuits force you to build out on your own, that's pretty neat.What is the proof of identity in Polar?Is it something like a token in Biscuits?I'm curious if you can do things like add caveats to reduce what the token is capable of as it gets handed off to different systems.

I consider that one of the \"killer use cases\" of biscuits.", "Biscuits are really cool, one day I plan to try and convince Geoffroy to integrate Polar for policies :)Currently Biscuits + Polar are ideologically similar but with distinct use cases at the moment. Oso is a central service that your backend speaks to whereas biscuits are decentralized cryptographic tokens.So Oso API calls are all done with service-specific API keys, and don't need a proof of identity beyond that.My mental model for tokens like biscuits is that they work like a \"decentralized cache\".I.e.you can take an authentication/authorization decision, sign it, and provide it to a client.They can reuse that decision at services without the service needing to reach out to the authN/authZ provider again.It would play _really_ nicely together with the Distributed Authorization concepts we're talking about here: a client could ask the authz service: \"I want a token for managing issues\".

The authz service/Oso could respond with a partially evaluated policy, like: \"this token grants the user access to issues that belong to repository 1, 2,3, or issues that they are the creator\" (encoded as facts to check a la biscuits).When receiving that token, the issues service would know what filtering to do locally, without having to reach out to Oso.The information passed around between the services mostly stays the same, but rather than make an API call each time, the necessary authz information is encoded in the biscuit token.And then next level: biscuits can cross federation boundaries and be attentuated, etc. So it really starts unlocking novel ways to integrate application-level authz with infrastructure-level authz.", "Biscuit maintainer here o/There's definitelt some cool use cases we could collaborate on.

One thing I'm looking at more deeply right now is tokens carrying the necessary data as they go through the system,to make sure one call does not see some of it rights change dynamically when going from service to service", "Quick addition: in practice everyone that I know uses Git + CI/CD for managing + deploying policy changes.", "Any such IDE needs a way to communicate with the services that are going to enforce the permissions. The DSL is a good way to do this.It allows inspection, diffing, and access by other tools, instead of being locked away in some hidden IDE binary structures.Edit: But no IDEs will yet have any graphical tool to assist in rule development and checking.So the fact that one is provided, is better than it not existing at all.But you can always edit the DSL manually, if need be.

Keeping the number of languages small, and keeping them purpose-focused (C++ for the heavy stuff, Java/Python for web backends, JavaScript for UIs) helped unify coding standards and conventions within and across teams, reining in the chaos that would have ensued had Google allowed developers or teams to choose languages willy-nilly.These sorts of language restrictions are not a knock against the skill of Google engineers. A good programmer can be good in any language.Even C++.Even Java.Think of the midwit meme, with the simpleton at the left going \"just write everything in C++ or Java\", the midwit in the middle going \"NOOOOOO!Lambda calculus/monads/Hindley-Milner type systems!\" and the genius/Jedi monk at the right going \"just write everything in C++ or Java\".The appeal of Lisp when writing production code is to lazy, mediocre programmers who think Lisp's sexy features will extend the reach of what they can create.

Which is true, to a certain extent, but a) not as much as they may think; and b) when you consider that Lisp programs are bloated and slow compared to the corresponding C++ programs, the juice just isn't worth the squeeze.Lisp peaked ~60 years ago.

It's tolerated though because it's standard practice, and we developers get a paycheck anyway.Languages like OCaml, Common Lisp, Haskell, and other niche but obviously practical languages continue to be indispensable to certain cohorts of companies and developers. While I do agree that Lisp specifically peaked in popularity decades ago, it still exists in the commercial domain with resounding staying power, even in environments where it could in theory be replaced by C++ or Python.It's also abundantly clear there's a hunger for new (or at least replacement) languages for the stalwarts.Rust, Julia, Mojo, Swift, and OCaml are a few such languages that get attention in their commercial investment and development, often with the specific purpose of replacing Python or C++.As a personal anecdote, I find professional Common Lisp programmers generally to be quite sensitive to matters of bloat.

Some programmers go as far to chisel away needless cons cells (or allocation in general), and constantly be in touch with the compiled assembly—something frequently ignored by professional C++ programmers of comparable experience.C++ and Rust programmers usually don't have to go down into the assembly. The language itself provides fine-grained control over when and how allocations take place, and how memory is laid out.It's a doddle to establish efficient allocation patterns and lay out memory to take advantage of locality of reference so you don't blow up your data cache.Lisp, not so much; in addition to the pointer-heavy semantics of Lisp objects you have the inherent nondeterminism of a GC.So not surprising that when a Lisp program stutters or hangs, the programmer has to go down to assembly level to determine the memory usage pattern that's causing the slowdown.

With C++ or Rust, the memory usage patterns are (usually) obvious from the code itself.> I would love to hear the \"very sound technical reasons\" explaining Common Lisp's obscurity.* Lisp is dynamically typed. Yes, I know Common Lisp allows for type annotations, but the type system is just barely enough to enable speed hacks in the compiler; it is neither sound nor robust when compared to, say, fully parametric type systems (now commonplace in blub languages like C# and TypeScript).The lesson of the past couple decades or so is that strong, static typing is an unmitigated win, especially when building large systems; to choose dynamic typing in 2024 is to forgo early checking of all sorts of bugs.* GC.You will incur a performance and memory consumption penalty using a GC'd language, an in this day and age with RAII and ARC, those are penalties you need not incur in order to safely, conveniently use memory within deterministic space and time constraints.

With languages like Rust we can get the same kinds of advantages with static lifetimes that we do with static types. There is no need to defer object lifetime management to runtime; and to do so just wastes electricity and contributes to climate change.* The syntax.Programmers are not just annoyed by all the parens.Today, they're used to being able to get a list of all the methods valid on a given object by typing '.' after the object's name.You need a certain kind of syntax to do that, plus static typing, and Lisp eschews both.* Lispers wax nostalgic for the Lisp machines, which were pretty groundbreaking in their day...but as the sibling to my comment points out, the tooling for other languages has caught up if not surpassed the best Lisp development environments since.Microsoft has had edit and continue in its IDEs since decades ago; I believe Eclipse got something similar later.Modern refactoring tools.Project Lombok.

If I were to go to production, I’d either wait for costs of a homemade board to come down a bit or see whether a traditional heterodyne receiver could do the trick.Hmm.

Five billion people are currently under 40 years old, so well over half the world’s population has never existed in an environment but this.A note based on this.

That's possible due to clever use of stacked gold codes.The design has allowed frequency-sharing with competing systems (eg.

Galileo) - you don't see mobile phone networks doing that!The actual signal sent has allowed things like carrier phase decoding, due to the locking of the phase between the modulated data and the carrier, which in turn gives far better pseudoranges and accuracy.Overall, the designers either had incredible forethought, or incredible luck, or some combination of the two.", "Hi! Yes, \"from scratch\" is definitely always a bit of a funny term.I also implemented the receiver in Python, which is quite far from \"scratch\" =).What I mean by it in this context is that I'm taking a piece of hardware that knows nothing about GPS, and just has the ability to sample the EM field, and building up a receiver from there.Re.

slow TTFF, or time-to-first-(position)-fix on older hardware, this essentially stems from advancements in processing power.Traditionally, GPS receivers would need to download the ‘almanac’ of all the satellites, which takes a minimum of 12.5 minutes (under certain conditions) due to the GPS data transmission format and speed. With modern processing power, though, receivers (including gypsum) can just ‘brute force’ the search space to find the in-view satellites, instead of using the hints downloaded over the air.This is the technique described at the end of Part 1.", "The fast TTFF on a typical modern device e.g.

your phone is because the device has the Internet, and so it can obtain all the information it needs from the Internet up front, it isn't magically brute forcing everything needed, that's not practical at all.The 12.5 minutes includes a rough multi-week almanac which you could perhaps brute force given available compute and receive capability (original GPS receivers have a single channel receiver and minute compute capability) but they more importantly include the ephemerides, precise data about exactly where the birds are and the atmospheric conditions, replaced hourly by a ground station. You can't \"brute force\" these - they're parameters measured by someone with objective truth like \"I, a massive NASA satellite ground terminal in Florida, am definitely not moving, therefore this GPS bird #14 is 0.08 metres away from where it should be, I will adjust the data for the next hour accordingly\".", "Yes, I forgot to mention downloading the orbital parameters over the network!

Thanks for mentioning this as well.In this case, I was meaning to refer to brute-forcing the Doppler-shifts and PRN phases of each satellite, not the orbital parameters themselves. The project in the OP is able to get a position fix in less than a minute because, if the subframe timings are convenient, you can retrieve the necessary ephemeris parameters from the subframes in that span (and down to as little as 18 seconds in ideal conditions, if my back-of-the-napkin is right).", "Yeah, the key reason this enables so much faster time to first fix is that the precise ephemeris parameters are transmitted much more often than the full almanac, but only from the satellite they apply to whereas each satellite broadcasts the entire almanac covering the whole constellation.

If I'm understanding the info out there correctly, every transmission of the ephemeris data comes with only 1/25th of the almanac.Most decent modern-ish receivers tend to have pretty speedy aquisition time without any assistance data.

For example, the reasonably ancient GPS running watch I use can usually get a GPS lock in a couple of minutes from cold with no internet access (in a wrist-sized device running on battery!), and even the two decade old SiRFstarIII chipset is specced to have a sub-minute cold start time without assistance and much shorter with - though I think that chipset was pretty advanced for the time.", "You don't need to brute force the almanac - why would you?But it's very much feasible to 'brute force' your initial signal lock by searching for all gold codes at a range of frequency offsets.And it doesn't take 12.5 minutes to get the ephemerides - the almanac is sent in paginated form which is why it takes so long, the ephemerides are sent more often - they repeat every 30 seconds, and they're enough for a navigation fix.Although 30 seconds isn't amazing, so cell phones do use their data connection to shortcut that wait.", "> You don't need to brute force the almanac - why would you?I have no idea, but the claim was that you get faster fix with brute force when I know that's not why it's fast in practice.> But it's very much feasible to 'brute force' your initial signal lock by searching for all gold codes at a range of frequency offsets.I hadn't even imagined this constituting \"brute force\".

Is my phone using \"brute force\" to find the WiFi router? At some point it's not really \"Brute force\" it's \"There are a handful of options, try all of them\" and GPS seems past that point especially on modern hardware.This actually reminded me of a (possibly no longer extant) design choice in Encrypted Client Hello - we don't necessarily know if the encryption was done with key F we gave out yesterday afternoon or key G which we just began using an hour ago, do we need a way to signal that in the connection?No, just try all valid keys.If you can't afford to try more than two keys, make sure you only roll them slowly so you won't need to.", "> I hadn't even imagined this constituting \"brute force\".

Is my phone using \"brute force\" to find the WiFi router?Early receivers were a lot less advanced than modern receivers - one of the key functions of the almanac is to help receivers figure out what satellites they can expect to see - thus greatly reducing the range of gold codes and time offsets they have to check.Unlike wifi, GPS signals are below the noise floor until the gold code is applied to despread the signal, and the gold code has to be synchronized with the received signal to detect it.The gold codes are pseudorandom and designed to stop signals interfering with one another.

Unless you know which gold code you're looking for, and find its time offset (accurate to about 2 chips in 1023) you can't tell it apart from noise.You also don't quite know the frequency you're looking for - partly due to the imprecision of the receiver clock, partly because GPS satellites move very fast and so can have a lot of Doppler shift (depending on where they are in the sky relative to the receiver of course)Back when receivers had more limited physical hardware, searching through ~30 different satellites, multiplied by ~500 different gold code offsets, multiplied by a few different Doppler shifts could be a slow process.

Especially if you'd found a handful of satellites, so some of your receiver channels were tied up with tracking leaving you with fewer for searching!So ignoring the almanac and brute forcing every satellite, gold code offset and doppler shift is one of the many ways performance has increased since this stuff was developed in the late 1970s.", "Small note -- the codes are named after Robert Gold, so being a proper noun, they should be capitalized, just like Gray, Hadamard, or Golay codes.", "> I hadn't even imagined this constituting \"brute force\". Is my phone using \"brute force\" to find the WiFi router?At some point it's not really \"Brute force\" it's \"There are a handful of options, try all of them\" and GPS seems past that point especially on modern hardware.Your phone only needs to listen to the WiFi router on one channel at a time in operation, and the signal parameters are well enough defined that they can be scanned quickly.

A GPS receiver requires at least 4 parallel channels to achieve a position solution, and there are up to 32 possible codes the satellites could be at. Scanning 6 channels across 32 codes, and then also sweeping phase and doppler shift to lock them , just to 'discover' if there is a valid signal there takes time, and this is what older receivers had to do.Modern receivers tend to just 'brute force' this by having an entire receive pipeline dedicated to every possible PRN all the time, and possibly even correlate multiple doppler shifts simultaneously as well, so they effectively have 32 (or more) receive channels, despite only ever expecting a maximum of 12 birds being visible.

The extra channels are necessary more or less exclusively to reduce acquisition time, so I think it's fair to call them 'brute force'.", "Related: Satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS), of which Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is the USA implementation.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNSS_augmentation", "As an EE grad, I would still consider what you did to be “from scratch”.

It didn't do lane guidance (which I don't find terribly helpful anyway), but some time in advance of every turn, it would announce the turn, including the street name.That version even had voice recognition, so you could say things like \"are we there yet?\" and it would announce the ETA to both the next stop and the final destination, along with current location.Lots of fun!30 meters (typical worst-case CEP under SA) is plenty accurate for road navigation in all but the densest areas, and even then, just glance at the map.Once you're out on the open road, it's brilliant.

I'm tempted to snag one off eBay and go on a roadtrip down memory lane.These days, it depends on what you're doing with it, but it's hard to go wrong with this thing that claims to have a U-Blox 8-series chipset:https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32816656706.htmlUniquely among such cheap receivers, that unit can even be configured to report raw data, and is thus the darling of the Galmon project for low-cost observers starting up.

Also fun if you want to play with (single-band) RTK, etc.(Dual-band has gotten \"affordable\", by which I mean \"under a kilodollar\", which is tremendous given where it was just a few years ago, but you'd probably know if you had a use for dual-band.)", "> I'll admit I was a bit disappointed to see that the hardware was just RTL-SDR.Somewhat surprisingly, if you went back 15-20 years, a lot of what the author is doing in software here would have been done in hardware.GPS receivers used to market themselves by the number of tracking channels they had, as cheaper receivers might only have the hardware needed to track 6-8 satellites while a more expensive receiver might track 12.So this software-defined receiver actually implements quite a bit of what would otherwise be hardware.

And of course it can track every satellite in view.The software-defined approach has some powerful benefits - for example, initial satellite acquisition involves calculating cross-correlation between the received signal and various gold codes. Being able to do this in the fourier domain lets you acquire signals pretty fast!If you want a hardcore DIY GPS receiver, going right down to the transistor level, you'd probably enjoy reading https://lea.hamradio.si/~s53mv/navsats/theory.html - an 1990s era DIY GPS receiver, complete with hand-drawn schematics, hand-drawn PCBs, even a hand-made antenna.", "I think even these days, a lot of what the author is doing here is still generally done in hardware for power efficiency reasons - it's just that nowadays, the hardware looks a lot like the software-defined architecture used here with a conversion to digital at the frontend followed by hardware accelerators for doing cross-correlation in the fourier domain.

Only with a jammer?", "GPS jamming or spoofing on a wide scale is definitely a viable attack!As another commenter noted well, making everyone appear at exactly the same location would be nigh-impossible, though.GPS receivers will look for the 'strongest' PRN signal in the noise, so broadcasting louder than the (incredibly weak!) C/A signal is a valid way to jam or spoof GPS.It is, however, generally illegal for civilians.GPS receivers operating with good practice do tend to try to mitigate this sort of attack, by (for example) ignoring signals with a too-high power level.It's a bit of a cat and mouse game, and there are academic papers exploring each side.Lastly, GPS receivers also need to deal with interference from GPS itself!

If GPS signals bounce off surfaces before reaching the receiver, the receiver might see two sets of GPS signals: one that arrived directly, and one that was scattered off a surface and arrives a bit later. This is called ‘multipath interference’, and part of what goes into making GPS receivers work well is mitigating multipath interference.", "> making everyone appear at exactly the same location would be nigh-impossible, though.I don't think this is actually the case.In a spoofing scenario, all of the rogue signals would typically be generated by a single terrestrial station.The time of flight of all of the generated signals will be the same, so all that matters is the position solution reflected in the transmitted signals, as the fundamental principle of GPS based on TOF is no longer in play.

So I'd think that in a typical spoofing scenario, all receivers thinking they're in more or less an identical location is what you'd expect.It might be possible in a borderline case for the receiver to receive some spoofed signals and some real signals simultaneously, in which case you'd expect weird results, but I think you'd definitely see a correlation around the position being broadcast by the spoofer.", "Just to be a little clearer, jamming and spoofing are the not the same thing. Jamming obfuscates a signal, usually through noise.

Spoofing impersonates the signal.", "You are talking about spoofing, not jamming.[1]This may be theoretically possible but is, in reality, practically impossible.Embedded within the GPS signal is the ephemeris data which, among other things, includes each satellite's location in space.Receivers calculate position by calculating the difference between the time a signal was received and the time stamp encoded in the signal itself.By analyzing the signals from a minimum of four satellites (one for each dimension in time and space), a receiver calculates where it is.To spoof all phones on Earth, you would need to trick each receiver individually. Since receivers are passive, they don't identify themselves, and there would be no way to target each individual receiver, making them think they're somewhere they're not.1.Jamming is obfuscating a signal, usually by creating a lot of noise that makes the real signal hard to find.

Spoofing is impersonating a signal.", "Regular jamming just degrades the signal quality.You can blast out fake data, but depending on what you mean by \"large area\" and a \"point\", I don't think what youre suggesting is possible.

Once both parties supported the civil rights act, the had to campaign on different issues.Democrats turned to a more academic and activist view on race, focused on using government to undo the effects of past discrimination.Legal equality having been achieved, republicans turned to social and religious conservatism.The more important piece of the puzzle is economics.In the 1950s, Ohio had a median income 57% higher than North Carolina.Illinois was 75% higher than Georgia.

That gap started to close dramatically in the 1970s and 1980s, opening the door to republicans coming into the south on a pro-business and deregulation platform.

Even as recently as last year, Alabama had a Congressional map struck down by the US Supreme Court for violations of the Voting Rights Act -- and the Alabama legislature then proceeded to ignore the decision and write a new map with exactly the same deficiencies [1].[1] https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/alab...", "> Following the Act's passage, the Southern coalition switched en masse to the Republican party.Except the switch didn’t happen until decades later.

Republicans didn’t win a majority of southern congressional seats until 1994.It’s also just fundamentally nonsensical to say that southern democrats protested the party’s support for the civil rights act of 1964 by voting for the party that supported it even more strongly and which had enacted several earlier civil rights bills over Democratic opposition.The more accurate way to see things is that democrats opposition to civil rights was keeping southern democrats in the party when they had other reasons to vote Republican.

The unsolved parts are unsolved as a result of bipartisan unwillingness to solve them.Example: Historical racism caused black people to lack the generational wealth to own a home.The solution to this is to make home ownership more affordable, i.e.to build more housing and bring down the market price of buying a home.

But many of the existing homeowners, who don't want home prices to become more affordable, are Democrats, so this problem is unsolved even in areas like San Francisco under 100% Democratic control.Example: Parents want their kids to attend schools with smart kids so the other students aren't disruptive and don't require the teacher to slow the pace of the class. The solution to this is to put kids of similar intelligence in the same class, which also helps smart minority students who can get in based on test scores rather than money.But then affluent parents with disruptive or less intelligent kids don't get into the smart class, so they prefer solutions where the metric is parental income (e.g.

ability to afford a home in the \"good\" school district) rather than test scores, and then get to feel good about themselves because even though this result is even worse for poor minority students, they can point to the statistics that minority students from poor backgrounds have lower test scores as a reason to refuse to use test scores and wrap their self-interest in the flag of anti-racism. Then many of those parents are Democrats, and moreover the alternate solution where you break up the \"income buys a good school district\" system would be things like school vouchers, which are opposed by public school teachers unions because they allow non-affluent parents to choose a private school if it's better, and those unions are a Democratic constituency.So again the problem goes unsolved, even in areas controlled by the people who claim to want to solve it.So these aren't the problems they spend most of their time talking about, because that would be goring the wrong ox.

This changed in the past few years as fast food prices went up a lot, even more than inflation on basic goods.I typically don't include citations because nobody is here on hacker news to argue about the finer details of academic studies that carefully control for all the factors, and most of us don't have the time and inclination to read the studies in details to see where the problem lie. Instead, we build generalized models of the world that incorporate a great deal of different data and use those to explain our observations to others.

My own model is based on 30+ years of shopping and preparing my own food at home, as well as working in fast food (MCDonald's), talking to franchise owners (always an interesting perspective into how McDonald's works), and regular restaurants.Note: I live in California, a state with a different economic distribution than any other state in the country (with New York and Texas being the closest comparable states in terms of wealth distribution, relative prices of groceries and fast food, amounts of transportation required to obtain food, etc).

What about storage costs- I just threw away a 2-week old pile of nasty ground beef that went bad before we had an opportunity to use it (totally on me, I should have cooked burgers for my kids a couple more nights).That's what I mean by \"fully loaded\"- when economists compare things like this, they don't just take the published dollar costs in a single location and compare them. They made a best-effort good-faith attempt at considering all the other costs which lead to a consumer making a decision.Also, fast food prices shot up in the past few years, faster than grocery prices.Most of the articles about this were written about 10-15 years ago.", "I used for cost comparison a pre-formed hamburger patty from Safeway.If it takes you more than 10 minutes to pull this from fridge, heat a pan and fry, something is wrong.You put it on a bun and put things on it and you eat it.There is no prep area to clean.Wash a pan and your plate.

This isn't even a scaling issue, this is negligible time and cleanup for anywhere 1 to 4 people. This is a real side by side comparison as a McD's quarter lb also has nothing on it requiring prep.I understand what you are trying to say about \"fully loaded cost\".It's also wrong.The fully loaded cost is still much lower for home vs fast.Unless you insist that you really desire specifically something like deep fried french fries, a specific cooking method that is extremely scalable and well suited to restaurant production and very inconvenient at home.

Like if you were making your own ketchup and mustard from scratch, that would be prep and would take time. If you've just got pre-made ingredients ready to assemble into a dish then that's not really prep.Hamburgers for a family of five with a counter-top mise en place...Place five buns opened up on a large cutting board (1 minute tops).\nSquirt your bottled condiments on the buns (1 minute tops).\nHand-rip your lettuce, five servings, place on buns (3 minutes tops).\nSlice tomato rounds for each burger (3 minutes I guess if your knife skills are really bad).\nTake ground beef and hand-form five patties (5 minutes tops).\nCook all five patties at once in a large pan or whatever you use (10 minutes tops - smash them if you want them well done or done fast).\nSpatula out the patties onto the buns and you've got burgers.Shouldn't take more than 20 or so minutes really and I even left the cooking part for last so as to not complicate things.

The evolution of this vector through time is given by the time-translation operator for the system, which can loosely be thought of as a unitary matrix U (i.e., a probability preserving linear transformation) equal to exp(-iHt), where H is the Hamiltonian matrix of the system that captures its “energy dynamics”.From the video, the author states that the prediction of the next token in the sequence is determined by computing the next context-aware embedding vector from the last context-aware embedding vector alone. Our prediction is therefore the result of a linear state function applied to a high dimensional vector.

This seems a lot to me like we have produced a Hamiltonian of our overall system (generated offline via the training data), then we reparameterize our particular subsystem (the context window) to put it into an appropriate basis congruent with the Hamiltonian of the system, then we apply a one step time translation, and finally transform the resulting vector back into its original basis.IDK, when your background involves research in a certain field, every problem looks like a nail for that particular hammer. Does anyone else see parallels here or is this a bit of a stretch?", "I don't think the analogy holds: even if you forget all the preceding non linear steps, you are still left with just a linear dynamical \nsystem.It's neither complex nor unitary, which are two fundamental characteristics of quantum mechanics.", "I think you're just describing a state machine, no?

The fact that you encode the state in a vector and steps by matrices is an implementation detail...?", "Perhaps a probabilistic FSM describes the actual computational process better since we don’t have a concept equivalent to superposition with transformers (I think?), but the framework of a FSM alone doesn’t seem to capture the specifics of where the model/machine comes from (what I’m calling the Hamiltonian), nor how a given context window (the subsystem) relates to it. The change of basis that involves the attention mechanism (to achieve context-awareness) seems to align better with existing concepts in QM.One might model the human brain as a FSM as well, but I’m not sure I’d call the predictive ability of the brain an implementation detail.", "| context windowI actually just asked a question on the physics stack exchange that is semi relevant to this.

You pick an encoding scheme (either the Lagrangian or the Hamiltonian) to go from state -> vector. You have a \"rules\" matrix, very roughly similar to a Markov matrix, H, and (stretching the limit of my knowledge here) exp(-iHt) very roughly \"translates\" from the discrete stepwise world to the continuous world.I'm sure that last part made more knowledgeable people cringe, but it's roughly in the right direction.The part I don't understand at all is the -i factor: exp(-it) just circles back on itself after t=2pi, so it feels like exp(-iHt) should be a periodic function?", "Yes, exp(-iHt) means the vector state is rotating as time passes, and it rotates faster when the Hamiltonian (energy) is bigger.This rotation gives the wave like behavior.

Clearly our choice of inductive bias matters, and the transformer architecture is clearly an improvement over other designs.Surely you wouldn't argue that a CNN is \"just\" aligning computation to hardware, right?

LSTM), or, depending on the sequence type, model them as a hierarchy of sub-sequences, using something like a multi-layered convolution or transformer.The transformer is certainly well suited to current massively parallel hardware architectures, and this was also a large part of the motivation for the design.While the transformer isn't the only way to do seq-2-seq with neural nets, I think the reason it is so successful is more than simply being scalable and well matched to the available training hardware.

But we also need to worry about actually getting useful information out of finite data, not just finite computing resources. That's the limit you should be thinking about: the information content of input data, not compute cycles.And yes, when trying to learn something as tremendously complicated as a world-model of multiple languages and human reasoning, even a dataset as big as The Pile might not be big enough if our model is inefficient at extracting information from data.And even with the (relatively) data-efficient transformer architecture, even a huge dataset has an upper limit of usefulness if it contains a lot of junk noise or generally has a low information density.I put together an example that should hopefully demonstrate what I mean: https://paste.sr.ht/~wintershadows/7fb412e1d05a600a0da5db2ba....

So there's two deceptions here: (1) supervision structures the training space; and (2) the individual training rows have sequential structure which maps to board structure.Complete information about the game is provided to the NN.But let's be clear, the othellogpt still generates illegal moves -- showing that it does not learn the binary conditional structure of the actual game.The deceptiveness of training a NN on a game whose rules are conditional probability structures and then claiming the very-good-quality conditional probability structures it finds are \"World Models\" is... maddening.This is all just fraud to me; frauds dressing up other frauds in transparent clothing.LLMs trained on the internet are being sold as approximating the actual world, not 8x8 boardgames.

Here’s a brief outline of the linguistic features and a sample sentence:Linguistic Features of the Frog Language\nPhonetics: Since frogs are known for their croaks and ribbits, their language might include a lot of guttural and clicking sounds, which can be represented in writing with characters like \"k\", \"g\", \"q\", and clicks like \"!\" or \"ǂ\".Syntax: We might imagine that frogs are direct and to the point, so their sentence structure could be subject-verb-object (SVO), similar to English, for straightforward communication.Vocabulary: Words would likely relate to their daily life—water, flies, lily pads, weather changes, predators, etc.Grammar: Simplified grammar with minimal use of tenses and conjugations to reflect an emphasis on the present moment, which is typical for many animalistic languages in fiction.Sample Language: Froglan\nFroglii (hello)\nLok (water)\nKrik (eat)\nZraak (fly - the insect)\n!quu (danger)\nǂogg (jump)\nSample Sentence in Froglan\n\"Froglii!

Lok krik zraak ǂogg.\"Translation\n\"Hello! Jump eat fly water.\"This sentence, structured in a somewhat English syntax for ease of understanding, would literally mean that a frog is greeting another and then mentioning that it will jump towards water to eat flies.The sentence structure and vocabulary can be further refined and expanded based on how deeply you want to dive into the language creation!", "You are more speaking about n-gram models here.NNs do far more than that.Or if you just want to say that NNs are used as a statistical model here: Well, yea, but that doesn't really tell you anything.Everything can be a statistical model.E.g., you could also say \"this is exactly the way the human brain works\", but it doesn't really tell you anything how it really works.", "> \"this is exactly the way the human brain works\"I'm always puzzled by such assertions.

A cursory look at the technical aspects of an iterated attention - perceptron transformation clearly shows it's just a convoluted and powerful way to query the training data, a \"fancy\" Markov chain. The only rationality it can exhibit is that which is already embedded in the dataset.If trained on nonsensical data it would generate nonsense and if trained with a partially non-sensical dataset it will generate an average between truth and nonsense that maximizes some abstract algorithmic goal.There is no knowledge generation going on, no rational examination of the dataset through the lens of an internal model of reality that allows the rejection of invalid premises.

The intellectual food already chewed and digested in the form of the training weights, with the model just mechanically extracting the nutrients, as opposed to venturing in the outside world to hunt.So if it works \"just like the human brain\", it does so in a very remote sense, just like a basic neural net works \"just like the human brain\", i.e individual biological neurons can be said to be somewhat similar.", "If a human spends the first 30 years of their life in a cult they will be also speaking nonsense a lot - from our point of view.Sure, we have a nice inner loop, we do some pruning, picking and choosing, updating, weighting things based on emotions, goals, etc.Who knows how complicated those things will prove to model/implement...", "My description is true of any statistical learning algorithm.The thing that people are looking to for answers, the NN itself, does not have them.

That's like looking to Newton's compass to understand his general law of gravitation.The reason that LLMs trained on the internet and every ebook has the structure of human communication is because the dataset has that structure. Why does the data have that structure?this requires science, there is no explanation \"in the compass\".NNs are statistical models trained on data -- drawing analogies to animals is a mystification that causes people's ability to think clearly he to jump out the window.No one compares stock price models to the human brain; no banking regulator says, \"well your volatility estimates were off because your machines had the wrong thoughts\".This is pseudoscience.Animals are not statistical learning algorithms, so the reason that's uninformative is because it's false.Animals are in direct causal contact with the world and uncover its structure through interventional action and counterfactual reasoning.

Humans (and other animals) absolutely are statistical reasoning machines.They're just advanced ones which can process more than \"text\" - they're multi-modal.As a super dumb-simple set of examples: Think about the origin of the phrase \"Cargo Cult\" and similar religious activities - people will absolutely draw conclusions about the world based on their learned observations.

Thats basically deep learning.", "I mean something specific by \"statistics\": modelling frequency associations in static ensembles of data.Having a body which changes over time that interacts with a world that changes over time makes animal learning not statistical (call it, say, experimental). That animals fall into skinner-box irrational behaviour can be modelled as a kind of statistical learning, but it actually isnt.It's a failure of ecological salience mechanisms in regulating the \"experimental learning\" that animals engage in.Eg., with the cargo cults the reason they adopted that view was because their society had a \"big man\" value system based on material acquisition and western waring powers seemed Very Big and so were humiliating.In order to retain their status they adopted (apparently irrational) theories of how the world worked (gods, etc).From the outside this process might seem statistical, but it's the opposite.

Their value system made material wealth have a different causal salience which was useful in their original ecology (a small island with small resources), but it went haywire when faced with the whole world.Eventually these mechanisms update with this new information, or the tribe dies off -- but what's going wrong here is that the very very non-statistical learning ends up describable that way.This is indeed, why we should be very concerned about people skinner-boxing themsleves with LLMs", "> Having a body which changes over time that interacts with a world that changes over time makes animal learning not statistical (call it, say, experimental).

These deficiencies were addressed by Bahdanau et al in an architecture that combined encoder-decoder RNNs with an attention mechanism (\"Bahdanau attention\") that looked at each past state of the RNN, not just the final one.3) RNNs are inefficient to train, so Jakob Uszkoreit was motivated to come up with an approach that better utilized available massively parallel hardware, and noted that language is as much hierarchical as sequential, suggesting a layered architecture where at each layer the tokens of the sub-sequence would be processed in parallel, while retaining a Bahdanau-type attention mechanism where these tokens would attend to each other (\"self-attention\") to predict the next layer of the hierarchy. Apparently in initial implementation the idea worked, but not better than other contemporary approaches (incl.

convolution), but then another team member, Noam Shazeer, took the idea and developed it, coming up with an architecture (which I've never seen described) that worked much better, which was then experimentally ablated to remove unnecessary components, resulting in the original transformer. I'm not sure who came up with the specific key-based form of attention in this final architecture.4) The original transformer, as described in the \"attention is all you need paper\", still had a separate encoder and decoder, copying earlier RNN based approaches, and this was used in some early models such as Google's BERT, but this is unnecessary for language models, and OpenAI's GPT just used the decoder component, which is what everyone uses today.With this decoder-only transformer architecture the input sentence is input into the bottom layer of the transformer, and transformed one step at a time as it passes through each subsequent layer, before emerging at the top.

The word \"attention\" itself is just barely intuitive, \"self-attention\" is worse, and don't get me started about \"key\" and \"value\".2. The key papers (Attention is All You Need, the BERT paper, etc.) are badly written.This is probably an unpopular opinion.But note that I'm not diminishing their merits.It's perfectly compatible to write a hugely impactful, transformative paper describing an amazing breakthrough, but just don't explain it very well.And that's exactly what happened, IMO.3.The way in which these architectures were discovered was largely by throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticked.There is no reflection process that ended on a prediction that such an architecture would work well, which was then empirically verified.It's empirical all the way through.

This means that we don't have a full understanding of why it works so well, all explanations are post hoc rationalizations (in fact, lately there is some work implying that other architectures may work equally well if tweaked enough). It's hard to explain something that you don't even fully understand.Everyone who is trying to explain transformers has to overcome these three disadvantages...so most explanations are confusing.", ">This is probably an unpopular opinion.I wouldn't say so.Historically it's quite common.Maxwell's EM papers used such convoluted notation it it quite difficult to read.

This skill is orthogonal to the mastery of the subject itself, which I think is the reason most descriptions sound confusing, inadequate, and/or incomprehensible.Often, the disseminating medium is a one-sided, like a video or a blog post, which doesn't help, either. A conversational interaction would help the expert sense why someone outside the domain find the subject confusing (\"ah, I see what you mean\"...), discuss common pitfalls (\"you might think it's like this...but no, it's more like this...\") etc.", "2.It's not malice.

The way I understood it, positional encoding is much like dates. Just like dates, there are repeating minutes, hours, days, months...etc.Each of these values has shorter 'wavelength' than the next.The values are then used to identify the position of each tokens.Like, 'oh, im seeing january 5th tokens.I'm january 4th.This means this is after me'.\nOf course the real pos.encoding is much smoother and doesn't have abrupt end like dates/times, but i think this was the original motivation for positional encodings.", "That's one way to think about it.It's clever way to encode \"position in sequence\" as some kind of smooth signal that can be added to each input vector.You might appreciate this detailed explanation: https://towardsdatascience.com/master-positional-encoding-pa...Incidentally, you can encode dates (e.g.day of week) in a model as sin(day of week) and cos(day of week) to ensure that \"day 7\" is mathematically adjacent to \"day 1\".", "This was the best explanation I’ve seen.

So for the example, it would contain the information to predict, let's say, the first token of the first name of the murderer.Expanding on that, you could imagine that the intent of the sentence to complete (figuring out the murderer) would have to be captured in the first attention passes so that other layers would then be able to integrate more and more context in order to extract that information from the whole context.

If each token is a node, its key vector sets the position of an outlet pipe that it spews value to diffuse out into the embedding space, while the query vector sets the position of an input pipe that sucks up value other tokens have pumped out into the same space.\nThen we repeat over multiple attention layers, meaning we have these higher order semantic flows through the space.Seems to make a lot of sense to me, but I don't think I've seen this analogy anywhere else.

If it was just “The Worst Product I Have Ever Reviewed”, that would be a perfectly fair summary—maybe a little clickbaity, though it doesn’t seem like MKBHD’s style to go on a rant and completely tear a product apart for the amusement of the audience, and that’s not what he does in the video, either. The “…For Now” vaguely implies that maybe, somehow, in the future, it will improve to the point where it is no longer quite so terrible, and there is some sort of hidden nuance to the otherwise strident tone of the first part of the title, that maybe there is some hope of the product one day, in the future, having some redeeming quality perhaps delivered via OTA update.You don’t know!It’s a mystery!And that mystery—the hope that maybe this piece of junk isn’t totally pointless after all—that’s the clickbait.You want to know what he means by “for now”!

Why just now?That's similar to asking why companies haven't implemented every anti-consumer practice imaginable to squeeze out the most money yet. <Major food producer> could've shrunken their product's packaging by 15% while retaining the same price two years ago, so why are they only doing it now?My guess is that, for one, this could be legally problematic in some countries.Also, if your competition isn't also switching to this model, your services would become a lot less desired.

However, as the population of internet users nears 100% in first-world countries all while the ISPs require constantly increasing profits, I can easily foresee something like this coming in the future.It would be a guaranteed money-maker - create more plans, where connection is throttled unless you're connecting to a Preferred Website, then ask companies to pay up to speed up their websites and upcharge users to get access to the full internet.> It's not unreasonable for ISP's in general to charge people based on consumption.Well, then they can do that. Consumption-based internet plans are extremely common - in some countries, even \"unlimited\" plans can even end up as \"several terabytes of data and then severely throttled\" plans.

Still, I don't see where the ability to discriminate based on what website you're connecting to comes in.Even then, it's very debatable that this is actually something that we need - given the present-day situation where internet usage is at an all-time high and ISPs seemingly have no issues building and supporting networks that make up for the average bandwidth that they can expect to use, limiting those services (barring a sudden explosion in average bandwidth use) would seem like price-gouging rather than rationing a limited service.", "imo it doesn’t matter if the article is about 5G.

Fairly certain someone could cobble together a much more compelling meta analysis about even worse adverse effects of psych meds on similar populations, but due to NAMI and big pharma I think there's pressure not to draw those lines too clearly.I think there's a clear bias in cases of big pharma approved meds to jump to \"Oh, it wasn't the medication, the condition just worsened\" and with psychedelics/weed to jump to \"The substance use is causing this\". Even when there is proof of RX medication worsening mental health conditions, it's common to have these relationships straight up denied by the prescribing doctor.This isn't to say that there isn't a similar relationship in psychedelics, but it feels really disingenuous to me to be mentioning this outside of the wider context of psychiatric meds which somehow get a free pass for causing a much wider and dangerous range of side effects.

It is a particularly common symptom in children and adolescents (which is why many paediatricians and child psychiatrists hesitate to prescribe them), but more rarely can happen in adults too. Probably some people have a genetic susceptibility to it.It isn’t purely about ameliorating depression, since the same side effect has been observed in non-depressed children administered SSRIs (which aren’t solely used to treat depression, sometimes they are used to treat anxiety too, plus some children can end up being prescribed them when they have neither, due to misprescribing or off-label use.)Disinhibition and increased impulsivity can increase the risks of suicidality/homicidality/etc", "I honestly wonder if it isn't less rare in adults or if adults just are more likely to fall through the cracks and to have whatever underlying disorder blamed on the behavior.

Many adults starting SSRIs are isolated, don't have great support networks or friends looking out for them and are meeting with their doctors for the first time.For all the doctors know, behavioral issues were underlying, things just got worse, etc.Anecdotal, but I've never once met a doctor who adequately described the risks of an SSRI to me as a patient, and even some who have pushed back when I've told them of my own dangerous reactions and other risk factors the drugs have.They really should, as should the risks of new psychedelic based drugs hitting the market.I don't have a problem with the study that's posted.

They never did anything for me other than cause unpleasant side effects.The best cure for depression I've ever found is Vyvanse/lisdexamfetamine.Is that because I was never actually depressed and my real problem all along was ADHD?Maybe...but, on the other hand, I'm pretty sure sometimes my depression has been an independent problem from my ADHD and sometimes a much bigger one.

The fact is, psychostimulants have an antidepressant effect, and are sometimes even prescribed off-label to non-ADHD patients in order to treat depression (generally only for \"treatment-resistant depression\", i.e. \"we've tried all the antidepressants and none of them work\").I think it could possibly benefit more people with depression (at least they should try it), but psychiatrists are discouraged from prescribing it for them (here in Australia, psychiatrists actually need per-patient government approval to legally prescribe stimulants off-label).

In practice, it is easier to convince a psychiatrist that you have ADHD, than it is to convince a psychiatrist to prescribe you stimulants for something other than ADHD.", "I can understand why you would have that reasoning, but SSRIs are commonly prescribed off label to populations for non-mental health related reasons, for example ED or urinary incontinence, and in these populations the relationship holds, leading to some governments and regulatory bodies to recommend or warn against use for these conditions.\"Although duloxetine reduced the symptoms of stress urinary incontinence and improved women’s quality of life, the harms related to suicidality and violence were 4 to 5 times more common with duloxetine than with a placebo, a meta analysis using patient level data by researchers from the Nordic Cochrane Centre showed.\"\nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i6103", "Wow, TIL, thanks!Any idea if the logic I wrote about is also true?

100% guarantee that when psychedelics hit the market, doctors will fall prey to overstating the harms from studies like this while turning a blind eye to the wealth of evidence of greater likelihood of harms in prescriptions they churn out without blinking an eye.I'm not anti medication, and I'm not saying that there are cases where the benefit doesn't outweigh the harm, but I do think the potential harms of each medication should be thoroughly investigated equally.

The FDA has officially put a \"black box\" warning on antidepressants that they can increase the risk of suicide, especially in the young, and so have its counterpart agencies in several other countries. All doctors know about it – whether they all take that risk seriously enough is a matter of opinion, some are much more hesitant about prescribing them than others are.And it remains an active area of research.> 100% guarantee that when psychedelics hit the market,Here in Australia, they only let psychiatrists prescribe them (started in July last year for psilocybin and MDMA), and only for individually approved psychiatrists who have completed a training programme in psychedelic treatment.This is similar to our existing restrictions on prescribing psychostimulants–which most Australian states only permit psychiatrists and paediatricians to prescribe absent special approval–albeit even stricter.

They'll likely relax the rules over time, but very unlikely non-psychiatrists will ever be legally allowed to prescribe them (outside of exceptional circumstances).From what I understand, the approach in the US is different, as far as the DEA is concerned, theoretically, any doctor can get a DEA number which lets them prescribe any Schedule II/III/IV controlled substance. However, in practice, there are a number of drugs which very few US doctors would dare write a script for, even though by the letter of the law they are allowed to do it, because they don't want the \"extra attention\" the DEA will give them if they do – methamphetamine is a good example.

(Technically, any Australian doctor can legally write a script for methamphetamine, but it is almost impossible to fill, because unlike the US, it isn't approved for sale in Australia–not because it is a controlled substance, rather because it lacks our equivalent of FDA-approval–the only way to actually fill the script would be to get a government permit to import it for an individual patient, and there is zero chance they'd approve such a permit unless the prescriber was a senior psychiatrist.)", "Seems like a pretty good system as letting doctors prescribe “psychedelics” can mean everything under the Sun.Also the training and approval is paramount, they are doctors not magicians and many don’t even have a good understanding of nutrition let alone this type of drugs.", "No problem, I like to spread awareness of this stuff!

I do think that's why doctors fall prey to this bias, and especially so in a stigmatized population.\"Ah, they were likely to have these symptoms anyway\".It would be interesting to do a wider study, but there already was a history of these companies withholding damaging trials and results so I doubt it would be done, especially given that suicides have occurred in these trials.I really do believe that these classes of medications are treated differently due to the great power the industry has on this issue.If you look up the background of NAMI it's quite suspect and reminds me about how doctors were getting textbooks that were written by the opioid prescribing company.NAMI goes on to inform public opinion and then this stuff becomes \"fact\".

I presume most OSes and distro's have some simple image viewer.

(Yes, via build.rs, but just as a dependency?)How would I even know?There are so many things wrong with this imo.Building a crate should generally be sandboxed, but this (cargo install as a concept, not this particular app) feels like the goal is the opposite of a sandbox, instead it’s a shared arbitrary named tool that goes into your path by default and gets updated an unknown times.I feel like this is going to bite the rust community in the foot at some point.", "I think you're fundamentally misunderstanding what is going on here, because your questions about \"namespacing\", \"being shared between objects\", and \"building installing things\" suggest your imagining a system that doesn't exist here.

Cargo, unlike a system like pip, doesn't have global files*, it doesn't have libraries installed to the system, there is no* global state to corrupt.The only \"side effect\" of running a `cargo install` command is that a binary is placed in `~/.cargo/bin`, which most rust programmers will have on their PATH.

This is the main criticism of using `cargo install`, it's not a package manager, it's a shortcut to doing the C equivalent of `git clone project && cd project && ./configure --prefix=~/.cargo/bin && make && make install` (but for binaries only, no libraries).* There is a local cache of checked out code, and the index of crates, which is generally updated every time you run a `cargo build` command that might need anything that isn't local. You can use this cache without touching the internet by specifying `--offline`, at which point the contents of the cache matters.The only reason to do this is if you don't have internet.I'm also ignoring nonsense that people can put in `build.rs` files, but pretty much no one does.

I guess.I get it, it’s convenient; but I think people are fooling themselves if they think having a binary on their path is no big deal, or that manually calling “cargo install” is the only way this can happen.FWIW, there is a precedent with serde shipping a binary (https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/releases/tag/v1.0.184 related discussion etc.

Programming languages can be \"simple\" or \"easy to use\", but it's hard to make a programming language that does both because software development has some elements that are complex by nature.

There are trade-offs to be made when designing programming languages.Overly simple programming languages are toys. No one uses them for real work because they are too limited or too constrained.Some programming languages like Python and Go (to some degree) hide a lot of complexity and are easy to use for many use cases, but the complexity is still present and becomes visible when you try to do something outside their common uses.Other programming languages (like C, C++, and Rust) hide very little and give the software developer more control in exchange for more complexity.

This requires more skill and care but allows for leaner, faster software.Rich Hickey has a great talk that highlights the differences between software that is \"simple\" versus software that is \"easy\": \n https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/", "I am refering to complexity of a computer language syntax, NOT the complexity of a computer program.Those two are completely different, don't be fooled.Some extremely complex programs can be written in assembly, the code and data structure complexity is unrelated to the computer language.Damn, and all those pesky downvoters on HN the second you talk about an unpleasant reality.Maybe the downvoting system should go away, as it may be AI bots anyway.

You can make control flow more complicated within a single function, sure.Goto in C is not a significant problem. Jumping between different functions in assembly is however legitimately confusing.This is something of a pet annoyance because various languages or coding standards decide to outlaw the friendly easy goto as it has such a scary reputation.This makes some algorithms much more complicated to express and others inherently slower.", "Someone made a similar claim in HN recently.I reviewed Dijkstra's paper and it doesn't bear out the claim.The C goto falls squarely under the scope of the paper.Dijkstra's paper is not strictly focused on a global, machine-language goto that can branch anywhere in the address space.In fact, Dikjstra mention that he would also like to banish statement like while B repeat A and repeat B until A, because we have recursion, which makes them unnecessary.

Structured programming was (comparatively) new, and advocating for it made sense, given that FORTRAN and COBOL were the major languages in use, and (at the time) didn't exactly encourage the style.", "I've been working my way through the latest volume of The Art of Computer Programming (Volume 4B, released last year) which is about combinatorial algorithms. One of the very first algorithms he presents Algorithm B, \"Basic backtrack\".It's like a generic backtracking algorithm that you could use to solve combinatorial problems (e.g.n-queens, things like that).Every time I've seen this algorithm presented, it's used recursion, because that's a very natural way to express backtracking.

But Knuth doesn't, he basically never uses recursion in his TAoCP algorithms, he expresses his algorithms in a \"flow chart\" style, not assuming things like stacks or subroutines (in fact, one of the exercises in the chapter is to convert Algorithm B to a recursive version, which he then quickly dismisses in the answer to the exercise as \"elegant, and works find for small problems\" but fundamentally not very high performance and not really clearer than the non-recursive version).So, I set down to implement Algorithm B in a generic way and used it to solve n-queens.

The way Knuth has written it, it can be straightforwardly translated using `goto`s (it has lines like \"if so-and-so, go to step B4, else B3\"), but being the modern, structured programmer that I am, i tried to convert it to structured programming using loops and if statements.It was doable, but when benchmarking, my versions were always slightly slower than Knuth's original \"goto\" formulation, and honestly I don't think they were more readable either. You had to add a bunch of variables to keep some state around that was implicit in Knuth's version.The recursive version was definitely more readable, but Knuth was of course correct, you pay a performance penalty for that readability.It was a real eye-opener.

Someone proposed a coding problem: I think it was writing a program that removes comments from C source, but preserves preprocessing directives and all else.So various solutions were posted.I wrote one that used a state machine based on goto; no control structures at all beyond assigning to variables and if/goto.That original poster then revealed his solution.

It consisted of mutually tail calling functions.He specifically criticized the goto graph solution.I claimed they are basically the same, and to bolster my argument, I wrote a trivial simple text filter which converted that tail calling solution to a goto graph.Tail calling is not a higher level feature compared to goto. It is only syntactic sugar which leaves the program with the same organization.In some ways, the goto program is easier to understand.Why?Because:1.The variables of the graph are all declared together in one place.Say you have a local variable x.All goto graph blocks that refer to x are referring to the same thing.In the tail program, every function that does something with x has to declare it for itself as its own parameter.It's not obvious that those x's are supposed to be the same entity.2.Typically, functional languages, like C, do not have named parameters.The state is passed among the tail-calling function via strictly positional arguments.

Not all functions have all the state variables, so a given state variable could be argument 3 in one function or argument 1 in another function.In the goto program it's very clear. If you have bar:\n x = s + 1;\n goto foo;\n\nwe know: oh okay, this block updates the x state from s, and goes to foo.In the functional version: bar(s) -> foo(s + 1)\n\nwe don't know what s + 1 is doing.We have to read foo: foo(x) -> ...\n\nok, we know that s + 1 will be called x in foo.But is that consistent?Is it the same as every other x we see everywhere in the tail call graph?We easily see that consistency in the goto graph: there is a single x variable in the scope of the entire graph; anything that assigns to x is preparing a new value for that x.", "> In some ways, the goto program is easier to understand.Why?Because:> 1.The variables of the graph are all declared together in one place.[...]> 2.Typically, functional languages, like C, do not have named parameters.

You could dodge ownership and start operating on data before/after it's created/deleted.A try-with-resources/using in Java/C# would no longer offer its guarantees.How about async blocks in general?

I frequently use goto in C to jump to resource cleanup code in case of an error.Always turns out more readable than the alternatives.I think I may even have used it in Go once, but I can't remember what for.Go's defer keyword obviates the above use of goto, and labeled breaks almost any other case I can think of.", "You might find splitting the functions into two works well.The outer one tries to allocate whatever resources are needed, the inner one assumes they have been allocated.

In fact I would argue that if you find yourself in arguments about the practice it is a good sign your team is at a level where you should in fact prohibit all use of goto.IIRC at least one of the revisions of MISRA specifically allows for using goto to break forward to a cleanup-and-return block, but others don't.", "> Update: I recently looked at the book \"Compilers Principles, Techniques, and Tools\". In it, it describes the intermediate languages that programs are compiled to in which typically all branches are transformed to goto and if ...goto constructions.The idea being that optimizations are done after the program has been transformed to a loopless goto riddled intermediate program.That seals it for me -- I say use goto whenever it makes sense.That same book also teaches something important: programs based only on control structures like if and while generate goto graphs that meet a certain important property.

All non-forward gotos in the graph are backwards gotos, dominated by the statement to which they branch.A situation like this isn't generated by control structures; it requires goto: if (condition0) {\n statement1;\n label0:\n statement2;\n }\n\n if (condition1) {\n goto label0;\n }\n\nWhat happens now that statement2 is reachable in a way that doesn't require/entail the execution of statement1.The \"goto label0\" is not a true backwards goto.Backwards gotos return to nodes which dominate the goto statement; i.e. go back to a point in the program that had to be visited in order to reach the goto.Here, label0 doesn't dominate the goto at all.

But if the compiler had made sure beforehand that the control flow is reducible (and don't break that in an intermediary pass), then it will remain so.I find that most uses of gotos in source code are still reducible control-flow, but which had just not been expressible using structured programming constructs in the language.

It had a fun firmware bug, where any time it changed resolution while using MST, there was a chance the monitor would crash or do one of several very strange failure modes.In particular, it would sometimes do what I would describe as \"crashing\" (go black and require physical power cycling to come back), or become confused on what I assume was the state of one of the two \"streams\" in MST - that is, the left or right \"half\" of the display would be incorrectly displayed, either by being entirely black, or as though it thought that \"half\" should be scaled to the entire width of the display, but only for that half.e.g. if we think of the left side as 0-50 and the right as 51-100, sometimes it would only display 0-50's content in 0-50, sometimes it would show 0-50 and the content that should have been 76-100 scaled to the width of 51-100 (e.g.

it scaled the right \"half\" as though it were intended to be the full span of the screen, and then only displayed the portion that would have been visible).My best guess about how that could happen was that the decoding for the two sections was handled independently and there were synchronization bugs.Apparently there's an A01 rev of the monitor that does not suffer from these, but Dell says the FW isn't upgradable, so I ended up trading it to someone else (with full disclosure of the reason I was getting rid of it, ofc).", "When the monitors connected have the same serial number the OS could just use the connection side to distinguish the monitors, i.e. where is the monitor plugged in.I gets bad when that is not possible, for example when using a bluetooth headset, where suddenly you hear someone elses conversation because you have the same MAC adress.

The child here is the monitor manufacturer, and you should have bought good equipment in the first place.It's like complaining about their half arsed HiDpi scaling options.

Whichever monitor does display, may turn out not to be the \"primary\" monitor if the OEM display driver is installed.Once you get your multi-monitor layout finalized and saved, it usually doesn't change unexpectedly though, and you should be able to turn on or off monitors in any combination after that.I think with XP, W7, etc there were differences in multi-monitor graphics adapters and their drivers over a period of time where sometimes the default primary connector would be VGA, other times HDMI.

For this reason when multibooting different Windows versions, I would connect a monitor to each of the display jacks at the back of the PC so I made sure to see something on one of the screens and not just a blank.A lot of times if you boot a PC with only one monitor plugged in, and it's not the recognized primary connector at the time, it boots just fine but you see nothing. And if you plug in the secondary monitor you see nothing there either.Until you reboot.Seems like unless it's proven to work otherwise, you need all monitors plugged in and turned on before you boot.If not the resulting performance or lack thereof can be disappointing.Different Linux live distros are fairly consistent with each other and usually work for multi-monitors by default without connecting to the internet or installing any display drivers.

If you do a lot of configuration to get your desired monitor layout the way you and your mouse like it, and it fails to persist for some reason, that would be about equivalent to booting a live OS which is by nature handling hardware in a default way as newly-discovered devices every time you boot. Kind of like the Mac that wakes up unlike the way it went to sleep.Like the article hints at, sometimes it's best to carefully wire everything so it's closer to what you want by default, before you start doing any tweaking.For me nothing is off the table.

First of all I like to have a PC for every monitor, while still being able to use dual (or more) monitors with a single PC whenever.In a multi-desk lineup with 5 monitors from left to right, every monitor will have an average of 2 or more cables or adapting cables connected in the back, which lead up to where the PC's are.First of all you have to really be able to get more out of 5 than you were 2 or 3, you may know who you are.That can entail a bit of manual plugging and unplugging of display cables, as well as OS & software settings for different workflow configurations, and the idea is to try and accomplish all that using the connectors at the back of the PC's. And minimizing the need to change cords behind the monitors if that is the least bit more inconvenient.But doing it anyway whenever needed.This can get kind of tedious, but eventually you end up with a fairly optimized procedure for extracting maximum utility from minimal rewiring.

And since it started out a bit better than having fewer monitors to begin with, that's when it feels really better. This is the point it may be possible to add some hardware switching for your display wiring (although a complicating factor) which could replace occasional manual plugging with manual button-pushing after that.", "I have had this problem several times on Linux, with different monitors, so it seems that it can actually happen on every OS.", "Yeah I get the feeling this article should be titled 'wierd MacOS bugs'", "This reminded me of a problem I had with my monitor last year - an actual bug had crawled inside the screen and died.I assumed it was a cluster of dead pixels and was planning to replace it.Eventually I realized what it was and learned you can use an electric toothbrush to migrate the dead bug to the edge.No luck in my case despite my best efforts.

I'm not sure if there was a problem with my methodology or my apartment was well shielded or what.My methodology was simple.On a Linux home server that had plenty of spare memory (non ECC RAM) I ran a process that simply alloced a large buffer and filled it with a pattern.It would then periodically scan through the buffer looking for changes to the pattern.I ran this for over a year which should have been long enough given the amount of RAM I was using and the rates that I found in the literature for cosmic ray induced bit flips resulted in several flips.My method would have missed a flip if the page it happened on had been paged out sometime in the past and that paged out copy still existed, and the bit flip happens between the time of the last scan and the time the kernel decides to discard that page.

On the next scan it would page fault and load the good page.But the system was very lightly loaded and almost never actually had to page things out, so most of the time if a bit flipped it should have still been there by the next scan and so I don't think this explains why I saw no flips.A few years later I got a Mac Pro, which had ECC memory. I used that mostly at work from 2008-2017.I got another Mac Pro in 2009 which I used at home from 2009-2017.I'd occasionally look at the memory status in System Report which should say \"ECC Errors\" if the ECC had to fix any errors and only ever saw \"OK\".I'm not sure if that resets on boot and I only looked occasionally so if it does reset than it is quite likely I would have missed an error statuses.", "My experience from a ~ 2000 server job with all ECC RAM is that errors cluster a lot.Easily 90%+ of the systems never had any ECC errors (correctable or no) in their whole life.Some systems would get one error a day.

A small number got 100s per hour until we shut them down. Even less got thousands per hour.One in my whole career got like 50,000 in the time between when it started running very slowly (from processing ECC interrupts) and the next hourly reporting interval.You might get close to the literature numbers by taking that one instance and dividing it over the total ram byte hours.Although that was probably hardware failure and not comsic rays, but then you don't get a different ECC code for comsic rays.Also, there was an expectation that comsic ray induced bit errors would grow as ram circuit features shrunk, but it ended up not happening; reasons unknown or at least I never saw anything suggesting a reason.Getting errors in a small sample of RAM is unlikely, unless you specifically induce them by using debug features or misconfiguring your system (but some systems conspire to misconfigure themselves, making it easier to observe!

You can calculate all n-squared interactions which produces teh completely correct result. But since atoms that are far away don't interact strongly (falls off as 1 over r squared or more).So you can maintain a neighborlist- all atoms within a distance R- cheaper than you can calculate n-squared interactions, with some tiny error that is unknown.It's assumed in many cases the errror is neglible and the speedup is huge.Or you can switch to using a particle-mesh method which involves taking a fourier transform, doing some work in fourier space, then an inverse transform.The results are nlogn, and the error is small (and known).Speedup is signfiicant but takes much, much more computational skill and infrastructure.Next, the case I'm referring to of an accelerator running a tensorflow job, it's a totally different scenario- here, some random subset of machines will repeatedly return the wrong result- say, for a matrix-vector operation.

Maybe garbage numbers, maybe all zero, maybe some infs.

This is very prone to aliasing if not done right, especially if you end up just drawing a line between the points.I found a good way to avoid aliasing by taking the min/max values for each chunk of samples and then filling the area in between rather than drawing lines between points.If you zoom in to a point where the window is only a few values, this will converge to the same result as just drawing lines between the samples.

You can test it out by uploading audio files to our audio-to-midi web demo: https://samplab.com/audio-to-midi", "My point is that everyone seems to draw waveforms using only two colours. Inevitably, this results in aliasing.In the extreme we have the \"Spotify\" visualisations of vertical bars with gaps in between.I believe this is popular because it looks slightly better than a solid waveform lump with an aliased edge.To avoid aliasing you need to use more than two pixel colours.", "> To avoid aliasing you need to use more than two pixel colours.The aliasing in question is of the audio not the pixels, so no more colours does not help.", "Agreed, there is aliasing of the audio.But also aliasing in the way that the waveform is rendered.Consider: would you draw a line, or a circle using only a foreground and a background pixel colour?", "> would you draw a line, or a circle using only a foreground and a background pixel colour?That's 99% simple pixelation, not aliasing.

If we want to display the waveform of one second of audio horizontally on an entire standard low-density full HD computer screen, we have 1920 samples to fit our 1 second of audio data, and 1080 samples of amplitude with which to paint the amplitude.Putting it into signal processing terms, The signal frequency here is 44.1Khz, and the sampling frequency is 1.92Khz. Do you see how aliasing applies now?We want to represent f_Signal / f_Sample = 22.96875 samples of audio with 1 sample.In practice you get an even worse ratio, because we usually want more than 1 second of waveform to be visible on a region that isn't the entire screen.", "> the signal is the fundamental shape (such as a font glyph or a triangle mesh or whatever)No.The signal components being aliased are frequencies e.g.repeating patterns.\"aliasing is the overlapping of frequency components resulting from a sample rate below the Nyquist rate.\"That is why the example is a brick wall and the result is moire banding.

Nothing like your shapes and jaggies.What you've mistaken for aliasing is simply pixellation.", "These are the same thing. A shape with a solid boundary is a a signal with a discontinuous step: If you Fourier it, it has infinite nonzero terms, therefore you can't represent it exactly with any finite amount of frequencies, and therefore a finite amount of samples.In the case of Moiré patterns in pictures, we have lines in the real world that need to fit into pixels that fit a larger area than the Nyquist rate of those lines.

The Moiré effect in pictures is just the interference pattern caused by this aliasing.If you look at just a column of the image, and imagine the signal as being the brightness varying over the Y coordinates, you can imagine the mortar being an occasional regular pulse, and when your sampling rate (the pixel density) isn't enough, you get aliasing: you skip over, or overrepresent, the mortar to brick ratio, variably along the signal.https://imgur.com/a/BiZcxG5Now if you look at the graph in that picture, doesn't that look awfully similar to what happens if you try to sample an audio file at an inferior rate for display purposes?In fact, try it right now, download Audacity, go to Generate>Tone, click OK with whatever settings it's fine, press Shift+Z to go down to sample level zoom, then start zooming out.

Eventually, you'll see some interesting patterns, which are exactly the sort of aliasing caused by resampling I'm talking about:https://i.imgur.com/bX2IFp8.png", "Its much easier to read the information with the aliasing", "> Since the number of pixels on the x-axis of the canvas is typically much smaller than the number of samplesThat's not the cause.

Both approaches can result in aliasing.I would disagree that the latter can result in the \"super aliased\" in question.Drawing one line per sample leaves very little aliasing.", "> Drawing one line per sample leaves very little aliasing.It's definitely gonna look better than just skipping samples, but you're also gonna draw a lot of unnecessary lines.", "The min/max solution doesn't prevent aliasing.\nConsider that if you do manage to avoid aliasing, you'll be rendering something visually akin to a downscaled version of a fully-detailed, high-resolution plot of the waveform.", "It renders a waveform that looks very similar to what it would look like if you drew a line between all points.

If you have 100 samples per pixel and you draw lines between all of them, you'll essentially end up with a filled area that goes from the lowest sample to the highest. So practically the same thing as just taking the min and max and then filling everything in between.The advantage is that you're avoiding all those lines in between.If you zoom it, the signal changes very smoothly without those aliasing effects where peaks appear and disappear.The web demo currently doesn't allow zooming in, so you can't test it there, but if you download the whole Samplab app (https://samplab.com/download), you can try out what it looks like when zooming in.", "Min/max does prevent the \"super aliased\" result in question.I'd agree it leaves a little aliasing.", "why not low pass filter / decimate the wave form to remove aliasing ?", "You have to down sample by a lot (easily 10-100x).That would essentially remove a lot of the information in the signal.

This way, your versioning scheme is less complex overall because it deals in fewer concepts.If you publish a sqlite4, and it can't share a process with sqlite3, mark sqlite4 in package metadata as being incompatible with sqlite3.

That's the practical effect of cascading breaking changes through the dependency tree anyway.I can't substitute the old thing with the new thing, so why not just give the new thing a new name?

But you usually don't need to cascade these things: if my library internally shifts from libfoo3 to incompatible libfoo4 and libfoo isn't part of my library's interface, why would I have to cascade the libfoo3 -> libfoo4 change as a breaking change to my consumers?", "This idea would require every package to name squat on the major package versions, just in case.", "If you haven't seen the \"SemVer rant\" in Spec-ulation you're missing out: https://youtu.be/oyLBGkS5ICk?si=ZL7MXObP7sWk7JaZ&t=1798", "I was about to say this is also the opinion of Rich Hickey (and me).

And to people about to mention types in python: those are also checked at runtime.People keep using these hyper dynamic languages and then running into these robustness issues and scaling limitations brought on by their very dynamism. It makes me mad and sad.", "No.It's a problem because you can only have one version of any given package in your dependency tree.You can't have `foo 2` and `foo 3` in your dependency tree.Without that limitation, there is a release valve of sorts where you can incur two different semver incompatible releases of the same package in your dependency tree in exchange for a working build.The hope is that it would be transitory state until all of your dependencies migrate.Rust, for example, has precisely this same problem, except that it is limited to public dependencies.For example, if `serde 2` were ever to be published, then there would likely be a period of immense pain where, effectively, everyone needs to migrate all at once.

Even though `serde 1` and `serde 2` can both appear in the same dependency tree (unlike in Python), because it is a public dependency, everyone needs to be using the same version of the library or else the `Serialize` trait from `serde 1` will be considered distinct from the `Serialize` trait (or whatever) in `serde 2`.But if I, say published a `regex 2.0.0` tomorrow, then folks could migrate at their leisure. The only downside is that you'd have `regex 1` and `regex 2` in your dependency tree.Potentially for a long time until everyone migrated over.But your build would still work because it is uncommon for `regex` to be a public dependency.(Rust does have the semver trick[1] available to it as another release valve of sorts.)This problem is definitely not because of missing interfaces or whatever.[1]: https://github.com/dtolnay/semver-trick", "It's a problem because you can only have one version of any given package in your dependency tree.

You can't have `foo 2` and `foo 3` in your dependency tree.That does seem to be the fundamental problem with the Python model of dependency management.If your dependencies have transitive dependencies of their own but your dependency model is a tree and everything is clearly namespaced/versioned, you might end up with multiple versions of the same package installed, but at least they won’t conflict.If your dependency model is flat but each dependency bakes in its own transitive dependencies so they’re hidden from the rest of the system, for example via static linking, again you might end up with multiple versions of the same package (or some part of it) installed, but again they won’t conflict.But if your dependency model is flat and each dependency can require specific versions of its transitive dependencies to be installed as peers, you fundamentally can’t avoid the potential for unresolvable conflicts.A pragmatic improvement in the third case is, as others have suggested, to replace the SemVer-following mypackage 1.x.y and mypackage 2.x.y with separate top-level packages mypackage1 x.y and mypackage2 x.y.

Now you have reintroduced namespaces and you can install mypackage1 and mypackage2 together as peers without conflict. Moreover, if increasing x and y faithfully represent minor and point releases, always using the latest versions of mypackage1 and mypackage2 should normally satisfy any other packages that depend on them, however many there are.Of course it doesn’t always work like that in practice.However, at least the problem is now reduced to manually adjusting versions to resolve conflicts where a package didn’t match its versions to its behaviour properly and/or Hyrum’s Law is relevant, which is probably much less work than before.", "As the article explains, this is precisely why the social expectations around Python package versioning are very different from JS package version (i.e.

you can't just break things willy nilly even in major releases and cite semver as justification).That aside, note the obvious problems here for any language that uses nominal typing - like, say, Python.

The Python ecosystem seems more willing to settle on a small number of de facto standard libraries for common tasks.Since types from dependencies can often surface in one's public API, having a tree of dependencies means that many libraries will end up referring to different (and thus ipso facto incompatible) versions of the same type.Leaving aside the questionable practice of exposing details of internal dependencies directly through one’s own public interface, I don’t see how this is any different to any other potential naming conflict. Whatever dependency model you pick, you’re always going to have the possibility that two dependencies use the same name as part of their interface, and in Python you’re always going to have to disambiguate explicitly if you want to import both in the same place.

If you do, do you release versions of your libraries without version numbers because the compiler will catch any mistakes?", "Theoretically static languages don't solve this problem, but in practice, programmers writing packages in a static language don't gratuitously break their API every release or so. Which seems far too common in Python-land.", "I’m not entirely sure that’s true, and I’m not sure it makes sense to extrapolate all dynamic languages from Python.Huge amounts of effort are expended on Linux distros ensuring that all the packages work together.Much of and maybe most of those packages are written in static languages.Many Python packages don’t have issues with things constantly breaking.I find NumPy, SciPy, the Scikits, and more to be rather stable.I can only think of making trivial fixes in the last few years.I have lots of exotic code using things like Numba that’s been long lived.

I’m guessing Flask and Django are pretty stable at this point, but I don’t work on that side of things.Packages undergoing a lot of construction still are less nice. I think that might be the nature of all new things, though.The example at the beginning of this article, TensorFlow, is still a relatively new sort of package and is seeing tons of new development still.Packaging in Python in 2024 still sucks, which is a uniquely Python issue.Python’s slowness necessitating wrapping lots of platform specific binaries doesn’t help.Seemingly even major Python projects like TensorFlow have really only just started making an attempt to version their dependencies.In one of the issues in the article, the issue was TF pinning things way too specifically in the main project.One of the satellite projects had the opposite issue, not even setting min bounds.

The Wild West of unpinned deps make it hard for upstream authors to even know they are breaking things.Many people know Python packaging sucks, but I don’t think they know how bad it really is. The slowness is also special to Python.Other languages like Julia and Clojure seem to be much better with these difficulties, and I think in large part this is due to early investments preventing the problems from festering.Rust vs C++ is a good comparison I think.Cargo is better than anything C++ has by far.In C++, it’s common to completely avoid dependencies altogether because the best you’ve had historically is the OS-specific package manager.The issue isn’t static vs dynamic.

It's not just the internet that has become a monoculture, it's the entire planet. Thanks to the internet.", "It's a nice essay but like so many in this space, it's really missing a key force that encourages consolidation, fights diversification, and pushes companies to centralize as much as they can into as few services as possible:Users.Users demonstrate, by their behavior, again and again, that they want simple, they want turnkey, they want inter-operation, and they want stability.And the big corps generally succeed in providing those things.Web 1.0 and most of Web 2.0 was none of those things.The easiest way to engineer those goals is to consolidate.Consolidated software developed under one roof can use incentive of money to induce engineers to figure out the \"grimy\" problems to make pieces of the tooling work with each other (such as GMail interoperating with Docs, or Facebook Messenger and Facebook itself).

And the centralized dev houses force consolidation; for all the jokes (justifiable) about Google having too many chat options, how does it compare to the world outside their garden? How many people actually go through the hassle to get XMPP inter-operating, since Google dropping support for it didn't mean it actually went away?Not enough.A consolidated dev house doesn't have to have multiple competing social network platforms or image hosts, etc...They can maintain one, maybe float the occasional experiment, and users don't have to worry too much about change.Users actually hate many kinds of change because they build their lives atop the predictability of systems they don't control and they get angry when those systems are altered without their consent.And to head off the argument \"But the FAANGs change shit all the time...\" They sure do.

Now compare that rate of churn to the rate of churn of how one stands up a web server, or how many non-FAANG online services have come up, run out of money, and evaporated.Inter-operation, at first glance, is the thing the walled gardens fight against. But ironically, by consolidating to one solution and letting just about everyone on the internet use it, they create an \"interior inter-operation\" to rival the inter-operation you can get with diverse solutions.Consider how much of Twitter you see doing a Twitter search vs.a Mastodon search, or how easy it is to find your coworkers on LinkedIn vs.finding (and using, successfully, through their spam filters) their email addresses.The single-service, one-API, few-clients model consolidates multiple things that users don't want multiple of...chat clients, search corpuses, histories, administration stories, username / password combinations, privacy policies.

And this all carries consequences (get locked out for legitimate or illegitimate reasons and you're now locked out of a very big garden), but they're consequences that hit the few; for the near totality, \"it just works.\"Regarding stability: Google has been around a quarter of a century at this point. Facebook about two decades.They may not last forever, but users understandably are more likely to stick with them than to try new things.

Every new thing is more likely to be a pets-dot-com than the next Amazon, and who has time to build familiarity with someone's bespoke solution just to get that inevitable \"We never hoped to have to send this message...\" turndown email?And this all culminates in the lack of proliferation of browsers, because the browser enables all these features and, at the end of the day, no user (rounding for error) wants to run two or more browsers and no web developer (rounding for error) wants to accomodate the undocumented implementation quirks of two or more browsers (quirks that always exist no matter how spec-compliant they are... If they didn't exist, they'd be the same browser).So there's the occasional cry of \"Why aren't there dozens of browsers\" without anyone really answering who wants that?Nothing about a \"rewilded\" net is impossible, but users don't want to do it and don't really want to use it.

Not nearly enough to make it into something as big as the consolidated service providers. It's a nice hobby for people who really care about how the machinery works to dabble in (I, too, run a Mastodon node...), but I don't see anything pushing people out of their Facebooks, their Amazons, or their Googles, in the near future.Not if the alternative is for regular users to have to do more work than they do today.", "This didn’t have to be the case.It was purpose built around these megalithic designs by these large companies.Now advertising and culture curation ensure it’s always displayed in a positive light.Google, Apple, MS, all know to use angelic white light in their branding (slight hazy, blurry, seems to penetrate where it shouldn’t be).Apple stores even mimic a church design.It’s not that people don’t want to.They don’t know any better and are addicted.These are not scions of capitalism.These are anti-competitive ecosystems by design.

They'd assign a routable IP to every computer on their campus, including the ResNets.They also handed out shared disk space on servers because that was new and novel.If you knew the right people you could even get a vanity subdomain on the school's domain.A significant amount of \"wild\" Internet content was found on those servers that lived on college campuses.Another significant source of \"wild\" content was ISP-provided web space.Most ISPs offered a few tens of megabytes of web hosting easily accessed via FTP.

A lot of HTML authoring software of the era could publish directly to an FTP account. While the likes of GeoCities and AngelFire get a lot of the nostalgia today, they were far from the only source of garish web pages filled with questionable content.In the early 00s colleges stopped giving out routable IPs to everything with a NIC and started cracking down on closet servers and web space.Besides the network security angle the MPAA and RIAA were on a tear suing colleges for \"hosting\" pirated content.ISPs also dropped their shared hosting around the same time.By 2010 all the major free web hosting services had shut down or enshittified to uselessness.Without those places a lot of \"wild\" content just died out.People did move to hosted blogs like LiveJournal, Wordpress, or Tumblr but even those weren't the same type of \"wild\" sites that came before.

The \"wild\" content has been further hurt by Google's algorithms' insistence that only content published in the past ten seconds is worthwhile and even then its only worthwhile if its SEOed to death and has Google Ads running on it.For the most part people just moved to social media. There's zero need for administration, bandwidth is a non-issue, and publishing is pushing \"Post\".The downside is its social media and discoverability or even availability outside the platform is challenging or non-existent.For non-technical people it's extremely difficult to set up a \"wild\" site on the Internet anymore.Even for the technically inclined it's a thankless pain in the ass to administer and keep up.If you do set something up it becomes a constant battle against spammers and script kiddies.

There’s been a huge uptick in interest in Darius’ work as networks like Twitter have fallen apart, and a new generation discovers the joys of an internet that’s as intimate and connected as a friendly neighborhood. And this hearkens back to that surprising, and delightful, discovery that often underpinned the internet of a generation ago — sometimes the entire platform you were using to talk to others was just being run by one, passionate person.We’re seeing the biggest return to that human-run, personal-scale web that we’ve witnessed since the turn of the millennium, with enough momentum that it’s likely that 2024 is the first year since then that many people have the experience of making a new connection or seeing something go viral on a platform that’s being run by a regular person instead of a commercial entity.

Jurors are asked to decide whether or not to punish the person in question for the crime they're charged with.Of course lawyers will try to screen for this view though. They want a predictable jury that will listen to every instruction given to them without question.When juries think critically and decide for themselves a lawyer can't predict which way the trial will go and a carefully constructed series of facts and yes/no questions during testimony may be wasted.Lawyers want a script and assured convictions when they can't get deals before trial, that's the whole game.", "I'm afraid you're mistaken.

Lawyers are not supposed to \"present the facts\".The textbook explanation of how the system is supposed to work is: juries are supposed to decide the facts after considering the evidence presented (either written or live testimony by witnesses), and then, given the facts they have determined, apply the law as instructed by judge (and argued by lawyers), decide the result of the case.In short, facts are supposed to be decided by juries, and law is interpreted by the judge after hearing legal arguments from the lawyers.

In that it is predominantly focused on protecting the property interests of the wealthy.

(The original police forces grew out of a desire to socialize the costs of protecting merchant investments -- the warehouses and docks and factories in much of the world, and slaves held as property in the south of the U.S.)Prior to uniformed police, communities maintained order themselves -- often through night watches in which everyone participated, or eventually through hiring people to \"cover my watch\".Police in the modern era have been used as a threat of violence against common people more or less since their inception in the 1800s, from slave patrols to strikebreaking. They've been used as political assassins killing the political opponents of the state (see Frederick Hampton) to the systematic oppression of gay and trans people (see, for instance, Stonewall inn).

Lest these feel like old examples, just this year police shut down a gay bar in Seattle for having \"indecent apparel\" being worn by the gay men in attendance.I think it's absolutely fair for people to think critically about the history and legacy of the institution and wonder, is this the best institution we can imagine to fill this role? Are there better ways to imagine the roles it fills today?Are there systemic issues that need fixing with it?The reason I bring this forward is that any thoughtful critique of the institution is often painted broadly as, \"you are just an anarchist who cannot think beyond your slogans!\" Perhaps the institution could do with some immiseration.", "Prior to uniformed police, law enforcement was a largely private matter, and private \"thief-takers\" were enlisted to apprehend criminals.

My understanding is modern state-run police forces developed in response to public anger over misconduct and corruption in the thief-takers, such as the Macdaniel affair.Particularly they were infamous for playing \"both sides\" by taking money from a victim to arrest a thief, then taking money from the thief not to arrest them.", "> Prior to uniformed police, communities maintained order themselves -- often through night watches in which everyone participated, or eventually through hiring people to \"cover my watch\"Dispensing violence as part of these watches was also generally accepted.

Is anyone writing rationally about this?", "Rome had a few different approaches, the Vigiles mentioned elsewhere in this thread. Several countries had armies enforce legal codes.Some places had night watches run by their local communities.Some had night watches you could pay to avoid participating in.It was considered quite unpleasant and low class to perform a night watch, so the people paid to do it were often those who could not otherwise find work or found it difficult to work elsewhere.In some societies you could seek justice via a duel, essentially calling out the criminal and relying on social pressure to see the duel adhered to.In England there's a system of tithings, shires and shire reeves, individuals who were kept employed and told to keep the peace.The shire reeves could muster people to enforce the law, temporarily.In the 1600s-1800s the monarchs in various countries instituted police forces, but they were typically plainclothes or carried only a symbol of office.(E.g.

a badge) These police were closer to what we expect police to be in the modern era, but were not typically or consistently in the same visible, standard uniform. (Though they may have carried, e.g.a sword that might mark them out.)The U.S.also had other police systems, including slave patrols, essentially self formed posses that would ride down escaped slaves.In the 1800s, police forces in England thought, \"you know what would deter crime?Visible police!\" And they began to standardize uniforms with the intent to prevent crime, rather than react to crime.Prior to this moment, policing was typically reactionary -- an aggrieved party seeking justice.

The innovation was that if people saw a neighborhood patrolled by uniformed police, they might believe that area was safer and criminals might go elsewhere.Around the 1860s, this idea really took off, and you see many places copying it.I'm on my phone, I'll dig for sources later.", "Great post, but I feel an aside on the England situation is in order. Prior to police forces, for anything too big for the Shire Reeves or Justices of the Peace to handle, the solution was \"send in the army\".This came to head at the Massacre of St Peter's Field (often called the \"Peterloo Massacre\", for example on its wiki page) where several hundred protesting workers were killed in a cavalry charge in 1819.The massacre caused such public outrage that, among other things, London set up the Metropolitan Police (a.k.a.\"the met\") 10 years later.

They were deliberately designed to be a non-militarised force: they wore visible uniforms, but they were black instead of the army's red; they carried truncheons instead of swords or firearms (this is also why most police in the UK to this day do not carry firearms); they were deliberately \"civilian\" not \"paramilitary\"; and they were \"answerable to the public\" in the words of Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel (under whom the force was set up). The preventative instead of reactionary nature of policing definitely fits into this context too.", "> Several countries had armies enforce legal codes.We do that now.The division of the army responsible for that is called \"the police\".", "No, you don’t.Police in the US is militarized but still police (which ironically is part of the problem, AFAIK.

They would have better training had they been in the army in some cases).Countries like Italy have Army corps (the Carabinieri and Guardia di Finanza) that do police work but are still part of the army, in addition to also having regular Police.

I think this is not uncommon in countries where Napoleonic France had a strong influence, but there’s plenty of commenters here with a better knowledge of the domain, so please correct me if I misremember:)But having part of the army do police work doesn’t really fix most problems with the police, of course.", "The problem is that they are equipped like the army in many cases, and certainly seem to have the mentality that they are some kind of counter-insurgency force on occupied hostile territory.", "No, the term for that is gendarmerie.If you've read my other posts you've probably been able to infer that I'm not a fan of the police, but I find that being quippy about them undermines actual meaningful conversation about their history and how they could change.", "> No, the term for that is gendarmerie.That doesn't mean anything.

Compared to the Army, there is a clear difference in reporting, accountability, access to weaponry, training, and cultural expectations.And yet, obviously, the Air Force is a division of the army (small 'a'). There are no civilians who care about the distinction between the Army and the Air Force, because it is meaningless outside of paperwork.This is also true of the police.They have their own reporting structures, accountability procedures, weaponry, training, and internal culture, and they are very clearly a military organization.Their entire purpose is to enforce the will of the state by using violence.They do not have any function other than that.And that function is what defines the military.", "Beautifully said.Your comment about slogans reminds me of the 'thin blue line between anarchy and order' slogan the police themselves use which, to me, is a bare-faced admission of existing to protect the property and interests of the wealthy by suppressing the rest of us.

Even as early as 1285, King Edward I put into law rules on the minimum number of officers (“constables”) per area.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable", "Constables are not the same as \"uniformed police forces\".Constables and shire reeves (from which we derive the word sheriff) did predate uniformed police forces, but they generally operated on the \"I'm the local law, and if necessary I can draw on local posses to enforce my law\".

A constable with the power to draw men into his service temporarily is not the same as \"these hundred men are full time employed as police officers as their job\".The men hired by constables were typically not uniformed, full time workers, but temporary muscle.The first, iirc, police force was in Glasgow in 1800 with London following in the 1820s.", "Also, IIRC, constables in England were not paid in money, they were paid in opportunities to dispense violence (which many men find rewarding for its own sake) without incurring legal liability and in opportunities to stick it to their enemies as long as the enemies were sufficiently low in rank.\"legal liability\": if you beat someone up in Medieval Europe, the big danger is not the authorities' sentencing you to jail, it was getting sued by your victim.England before 1780 or so was organized for the benefit of the artistocracy (barons and higher ranks).

You can see just from the fact that constables were not paid a salary that they probably were a net harm (more of a menace than a help) to the common person, but they were a net benefit to the aristocracy because they generally kept commerce humming along at an faster rate than it would have without the constables and because any constable that messed with an aristocrat would be harshly punished. (The aristocrats specialized in military violence, but it was tedious for them to moderate disputes between commoners, so they farmed some of that work out the the constables, who of course were commoners.) When historians say the world's first police force started in England in 1810 or whatever year it was, they mean the first force with a monopoly on violence that was a net benefit to the every class of society including the commoners.", "> The first, iirc, police force was in Glasgow in 1800They were a thing in Imperial Rome [1].

The exceptions were the civilisations which invested into legal systems and the investigation of crimes, and even then generally only for a minority.One could argue that industrialisation increased the value of a human life enough that a lord dealing with crimes by murdering random peasants (or a nightwatch \"cleansing\" its community by beating up a pariah) became untenable.", "My understanding of the vigiles was that they were under the direct command of centurions, despite being largely slaves, and were organized into barracks.

Vigiles could achieve higher or more desirable ranks directly through their service.The vigiles centurions were military men.I think it's fair to say, \"welllll sorta\" to my assertion that they were military, given it was predominantly their individual commanders that were military. But I would assert most folks would find it unfamiliar to think of their local police force being commanded by a military commander.Edit: I want to address directly the idea that the role of police would be conducted by the army, historically.One, sorta, depends historically, but two that's reinforcing my point -- the role police fill has been achieved by many different things in human history, from mobs to armies to uniformed civilian police.We must not accept that the police as they exist today are the only way policing can be done.

So often, people fail to imagine better or different ways of achieving that role because they assume it's the way it's always been.My whole point is that police, as we understand them today, is not the way they've always been. We can and should question whether this latest evolution of the role is still the right one.", "> the vigiles was that they were under the direct command of centurions, despite being largely slaves, and were organized into barracksI've had difficulty determining if these were military centurions, or a broader use of the term.Also realised: it’s uniquely difficult to draw a civil-military distinction in ancient Rome given how they thought about leadership--a good politician was a good general and vice versa.

The first knot is already in place and they just do the bow. I don't think how most people would tie their shoes would work well for a robot (bunny around tree method[0]) but I actually tie my shoes like this[1].This is the same way the robot ties.So I gotta ask, was this a purely learned policy or was this taught or pushed in that direction[^]?I suspect the latter.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwqQvKtmefE[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPIgR89jv3Q[^] by pushed in that way, would include watching that video or any other videos like it.", "This is an imitation learning policy running on the robot, which means that the robot was taught by hours and hours of humans controlling it to do the task.

I would say that the clothes folding task in the UBTECH video is much, much easier than the ones in Google's videos.In fact, it could potentially be performed by simple replay of scripted motions with no sensing at all (with low reliability).I have some things I always look for when I'm watching robot demo videos:1.Are there cuts in the video?If so, the robot may not be able to perform the entire task by itself without help.UBTECH's video has a couple of cuts.Google's videos have none.2.Is the video sped up?If so, the robot may be very slow.

UBTECH's video is 1x which is good, but you can see that the robot does move somewhat slowly and does not switch fluidly between actions. Google posted both 1x and 2x-20x videos so that you can easily see both real time speed and long duration reliability.In the 1x videos Google's robot is also somewhat slow, however it seems to switch more fluidly between actions than UBTECH.3.Is the initial state at the start of the video realistic?If not, the robot may not be able to start the task without help.UBTECH's video starts with a carefully folded and perfectly flat shirt already in the hands of the robot.Google's videos start with shirts relatively messily placed on tables and somewhat crumpled.4.Is the task repeated?If not, the robot may be very unreliable at finishing the task.Google's videos show a lot of repetition without cuts.UBTECH's video shows only one instance (with cuts).You could still produce this video even if the UBTECH robot fails 90% of the time.5.

Is there variation in the repeated tasks? If not, the robot may fail if there is any variation.Google shows different colors and initial states of shirts, and also a much larger sweater.That said, almost all the shirts are small polo shirts and the robot would certainly not generalize to anyone's real closet of varied clothes.6.Does the robot react to mistakes or other unexpected events?If not, it may be mostly playback of pre-recorded motions with little or no sensing influencing the robot's behavior.UBTECH's video shows alleged sensing, but doesn't show any unexpected things or mistakes.Google's videos show the robot recovering from mistakes.", "> 1x/realtimeYou can see at 1:05 how the man suddendly accelerates.", "Yeah, some weird things.Eg.Folding the shirt already in his hands, ...Like it can't pick it up with 2 hands?Some other weird things in that video too", "At the end of the OP video, why does the right arm grab the hanger then hand it to the left arm?

Seems like a highly unnecessary and inefficient step", "There will always need to be a \"wasted\" step. The hanger comes off the rack with the hook away from the robot and has to go back on that way.Since there are two shoulders of the hanger to put into the shirt, they have to hand the hanger to from one to the other, and that would leave the hook facing the last robot if they don't do this extra step.", "Couldn't the left arm just take the hanger off the rod?", "I don't see that it helps, since the task is symmetrical.

Whichever arm takes it off has to give it to the other arm at some point so both sides of the hanger are used, and it needs to be given back either before or after doing the hanging so the hanger's hook is back on the outside (facing away from the arm holding it), before replacing it on the rack.Would be interesting to know if the AI figured this out (the hard way, I'm sure).", "As usual, people get over-excited about videos that seem to be showing robots doing something useful, when in truth they're doing something that shows how far away we are from robotic autonomy. It's like the dancing robot videos by Boston Dynamics all over again.The Aloha systems in this video are just as scripted as Boston Dynamics robots.

The difference is in how the robots' behaviours are scripted: instead of hard-coding Finite State Controllers, the behaviours are programmed by demonstration, through teleoperation.The end result is the same: the final system can do one thing, and do it well enough to put in a video, but it can't deal with changes to the environment or to the initial setup of the task.For instance, in the shoe-lace tying part of the video, the shoe is already placed neatly in between the two arms and only at a small angle away from the vertical, the laces are pulled to the side and of course the knot is already half-tied.

If you changed those initial parameters by a few units, placed the shoe further towards the top or bottom of the table, had both laces on one side, or turned the shoe in a right angle to the arms, the system would fail.Despite the \"generalisation to sweater\" video, there's very little flexiblity and very little generalisation, and that's still a system that can perform a handful of discrete tasks (swap gripper, tie shoelaces, hang shirt). That's not a system that can function autonomously in the real world.No robot maids or android valets coming in a shop near you any time soon, I'm afraid.In the foreseeable future the most successful autonomous systems will remain self-guided munition, which are made to be destroyed on impact and cause maximum damage.", "There's something odd about the way the arms move, like they are two distinct entities cooperating rather than being part of one coordinated mind.

Maybe this is an example of the uncanny valley, or maybe it's because they are two physically separate arms, but it seems to me like one arm moves while the other waits for its turn. It's as if engineers programmed them to work sequentially.I wonder if it might be beneficial for engineers to study videos of humans doing these tasks and try to mimic those movements rather than trying to program a sequential procedure.", "Now I'm trying to imagine how our limb movements might be perceived by a creature that natively evolved the style of coordination in the video :) it would be \"weird\" but how might they describe that weirdness and what might underlie it in us..?", "Look, it moves its mouth while it reads.Like it can't do one thing without doing the other thing moving at the same time", "Which reminds me of my favorite interpretation of \"They're made out of meat\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tScAyNaRdQ", "this was good", "The policy is trained from human demonstrations.

If I'm tele-operating a robot, I'm going to be much less coordinated than if I just use my own two hands to hang a tshirt.", "If you monitor your own movements you’ll find plenty of sequential procedures.The big difference with how these robot arms move is that they are firmly planted on a large table, whereas your arms attached to this self-balancing, lightweight gyrating torso.", "I feel we tend to coordinate movements to balance ourselves, specially with arms.In this case, the arms are independent from each other and are each firmly fixed to the table.", "Sometimes I feel this about myself...I don't think much to walk or do something with both hands, they work stuff out on their own.

Better learn from your mistakes than from the mistakes of others, they are more efficient and informative.When an AI is set up to learn from its own mistakes it might turn out like AlphaZero, who rediscovered the strategy of Go from scratch. LLMs are often incapable of solving complex tasks, but they are greatly helped by evolutionary algorithms.If you combine LLMs with EA you get black box optimization and intuition.It's all based on learning from the environment, interactivity & play.LLMs can provide the mutation operation, or function as judge to select surviving agents, or act as the agents themselves.", "I guess this is obvious in retrospect..but having two arms vs one greatly expands the range of possible tasks.", "Skin is also incredible when you think about it.Each square cm is able to sense temperature, texture, whether it’s wet, sticky, etc.And it’s self healing.

It’s hard to imagine robots getting very far without artificial skin.", "Your point is entirely valid despite my critiques.Technically, skin can't sense whether something is wet, and isn't particularly great at sensing temperature. Skin senses pressure and heat flow (derived via sensing temperature change of the flesh itself, rather than the temperature of the object it is touching), and perhaps can sense shear (there is a unique sensation when skin is stretched/pulled apart), as well as the weight of an object (if it is absorbent and more wet than damp).This distinction about what skin can directly sense manifests itself to deceive the human brain about wetness and temperature, specifically.Wetness is a perception derived from feeling higher-than-expected heat loss and unusual pressure/sheer, and even through the sound made when squeezing an absorbent material or the sensation of water pooling around the finger (broadening the area of heat loss) when you squeeze into the material.

Damp laundry at room temperature is perceived as obviously wet because it feels colder than it should if it were dry, but when we're pulling laundry out of a dryer we often can't tell if it's dry vs. still a bit damp -- the higher temperature of the object removes the sensation of heat flowing away from our fingers, so there's nothing our fingers can sense to tell us the clothes aren't dry until the clothes finally cool down to room temperature.Our skin also doesn't sense the temperature of an object well if that object has a particularly high or low heat transfer coefficient of conduction.I recently bought a 6-pack of beer cans which have a moderately thick plastic vinyl label shrunk around the can.When I reach in my fridge, I can't convince myself to perceive it as chilled no matter how hard I try.

Even though the vinyl is the same temperature as everything else in the fridge, it doesn't pull heat out of my finger tissue, so my brain cannot perceive that it isn't \"room temperature\". Conversely, picking up a normal metal can of beer that is just barely below room temperature, my brain perceives it to be much colder than it actually is because the metal draws heat away from my fingers so quickly compared to other objects.If wood is cooled 5 degrees below room temperature, it doesn't feel cold, but a can of beer certainly does!It is absolutely incredible that our skin can sense things to such a high resolution that it seems like we have a lot more abilities than we actually have.It is also amazing how our brain integrates this into a rich perception.

But there actually aren't many physical properties actually being measured, and this distinction matters sometimes for edge cases, some of which are quite common.", "> skin can't sense whether something is wetAh the \"Are the clothes in the dryer cold or are they wet\" effect.", "Skin can’t sense “wet” can it?

I'm not against Aloha as an _affordable_ platform, but skimping on hardware is kind of a bug not a feature.Moreover it's not even _lowcost_, its BoM is still like 20k and collecting all the data is labor intensive and not cheap.And if we're focusing on the idea, it has existed since the 1950s and they were doing it relatively well then:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcIKaKsf4cM", "> skimping on hardware is kind of a bug not a feature.I have to disagree here.Not for 20k, but if you could really build a robot arm out of basically a desk lamp, some servos and a camera and had some software to control it as precisely as this video claims it does, this would be a complete game changer.

We'd probably see an explosion of attempts to automate all kind of everyday household tasks that are infeasible to automate cost-effectively today (folding laundry, cleaning up the room, cooking, etc)Also, every self-respecting maker out there would probably try to build one :)> And if we're focusing on the idea, it has existed since the 1950s and they were doing it relatively well then:I don't quite understand how the video fits here. That's a manually operated robot arm.The point of Aloha is that it's fully controlled by software, right?", "If you want a robot that can fold your laundry, clean your room and cook, you need a lot more than cheap hardware.You need an autonomous agent (i.e.\"an AI\") that can guide the hardware to accomplish the task.We're still very far from that and you certainly can't do that with ALOHA, in practice, despite what the videos may seem to show.

For each of the few, discrete, tasks that you see in the videos, the robot arms have to be trained by demonstration (via teleoperation) and the end result is a system that can only copy the operator's actions with very little variation.You can check this in the Mobile ALOHA paper on arxiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02117) where page 6 shows the six tasks the system has been trained to perform, and the tolerances in the initial setup. So e.g.in the shrimp cooking task, the initial position of the robot can vary by 10cm and the position of the implements by 2cm.

If everything is not set up just so, the task will fail.What all this means is that if you could assemble this \"cheap\" system you'd then have to train it by a few hundred demonstrations to fold your laundry, and maybe it could do it, probably not, and if you moved the washing machine or got a new one, you'd have to train all over again.As to robots cleaning up your room and cooking, those are currently in the realm of science fiction, unless you're a zen ascetic living in an empty room and happy to eat beans on toast every day. Beans from a can, that is.You'll have to initialise the task by opening the can yourself, obviously.You have a toaster, right?", "These videos are all autonomous.They didn't have that in the 1950s.", "I can appreciate that, but also they are recording and replaying motor signals from specific teleoperation demonstrations.Something that _was_ possible in the 1950s.You might say that it is challenging to replay demonstrations well on lower-quality hardware.

And so there is academic value in trying to make it work on worse hardware, but it would not be my goto solution for real industry problems. E.g.this is not a route I would fund for a startup, for example.", "They do not replay recorded motor signals.They use recorded motor signals only to train neural policies, which then run autonomously on the robot and can generalize to new instances of a task (such as the above video generalizing to an adult size sweater when it was only ever trained on child size polo shirts).Obviously some amount of generalization is required to fold a shirt, as no two shirts will ever be in precisely the same configuration after being dropped on a table by a human.

Playback of recorded motor signals could never solve this task.", "I appreciate that going from polo shirts to sweaters is a form of \"generalisation\" but that's only interesting because of the extremely limited capability for generalisation that systems have when they're trained by imitation learning, as ALOHA.Note for example that all the shirts in the videos are oriented in the same direction, with the neck facing to the top of the video. Even then, the system can only straighten a shirt that lands with one corner folded under it after many failed attempts, and if you turned a shirt so that the neck faced downwards, it wouldn't be able to straighten it and hang it no matter how many times it tried.Let's not even talk about getting a shirt tangled in the arms themselves (in the videos, a human intervenes to free the shirt and start again).It's trained to straighten a shirt on the table, with the neck facing one way [1].So the OP is very right.

We're no nearer to real-world autonomy than we were in the '50s. The behaviours of the systems you see in the videos are still hard-coded, only they're hard-coded by demonstration, with extremely low tolerance for variation in tasks or environments, and they still can't do anything they haven't been painstakingly and explicitly shown how to do.This is a sever limitation and without a clear solution to it there's no autonomy.On the other hand, ιδού πεδίον δόξης λαμπρόν, as we say in Greek.This is a wide open field full of hills to plant one's flag on.There's so much that robotic autonomy can't yet do that you can get Google to fund you if you can show a robot tying half a knot.__________________[1] Note btw that straightening the shirt is pointless: it will straighten up when you hang it.

That's just to show the robot can do some random moves and arrive at a result that maybe looks meaningful to a human, but there's no way to tell whether the robot is sensing that it achieved a goal, or not. The straightening part is just a gimmick.", "> recorded motor signals only to train neural policiesIs interesting that they are using \"Leader Arms\" [0] to encode tasks instead of motion capture.Is it just a matter of reduced complexity to get off the ground?I suppose the task of mapping human arm motion to what a robot can do is tough.0.https://www.trossenrobotics.com/widowx-aloha-set", "We're building software for neuromorphic cameras specifically for robotics.If robots could actually understand motion in completely unconstrained situations, then both optimal control and modern ML techniques would easily see uplift in capability (i.e.

Replay would not be able handle even tiny variations in the starting positions of the shirt.", "So, a couple things here.It is true that replay in the world frame will not handle initial position changes for the shirt.But if the commands are in the frame of the end-effector and the data is object-centric, replay will somewhat generalize.(Please also consider the fact that you are watching the videos that have survived the \"should I upload this?\" filter.)The second thing is that large-scale behavior cloning (which is the technique used here), is essentially replay with a little smoothing.

Not bad inherently, but just a fact.My point is that there was an academic contribution made back when the first aloha paper came out and they showed doing BC on low-quality hardware could work, but this is like the 4th paper in a row of sort of the same stuff.Since this is YC, I'll add - As an academic (physics) turned investor, I would like to see more focus on systems engineering and first-principles thinking. Less PR for the sake of PR.I love robotics and really want to see this stuff take off, but for the right reasons.", "> large-scale behavior cloning (which is the technique used here), is essentially replay with a little smoothingA definition of \"replay\" that involves extensive correction based on perception in the loop is really stretching it.But let me take your argument at face value.This is essentially the same argument that people use to dismiss GPT-4 as \"just\" a stochastic parrot.

Two things about this:One, like GPT-4, replay with generalization based on perception can be exceedingly useful by itself, far more so than strict replay, even if the generalization is limited.Two, obviously this doesn't generalize as much as GPT-4. But the reason is that it doesn't have enough training data.With GPT-4 scale training data it would generalize amazingly well and be super useful.Collecting human demonstrations may not get us to GPT-4 scale, but it will be enough to bootstrap a robot useful enough to be deployed in the field.Once there is a commercially successful dextrous robot in the field we will be able to collect orders of magnitude more data, unsupervised data collection should start to work, and robotics will fall to the bitter lesson just as vision, ASR, TTS, translation, and NLP before.", "\"Limited generalisation\" in the real world means you're dead in the water.

Like the Greek philosopher Heraclitus pointed out 2000+ years go, the real world is never the same environment and any task you want to carry out is not the same task the second time you attempt it (I'm paraphrasing). The systems in the videos can't deal with that.They work very similar to industrial robots: everything has to be placed just so with only centimeters of tolerance in the initial placement of objects, and tiny variations in the initial setup throw the system out of whack.As the OP points out, you're only seeing the successful attempts in carefully selected videos.That's not something that you can solve with learning from data, alone.A real-world autonomous system must be able to deal with situations that it has no experience with, it has to be able to deal with them as they unfold, and it has to learn from them general strategies that it can apply to more novel situations.

You can tell there was a big shift from the RL approaches trying to do very generalizing algorithms to more recent works that are heavily focused on this arms/manipulators because end-effector control enables more flashy results.Another limiting factor is that data collection is a big problem: not only will you never be sure you've collected enough data, they're collecting data of a human trying to do this work through a janky teleoperation rig. The behavior they're trying to clone is of a human working poorly, which isn't a great source of data!Furthermore limiting the data collection to (typically) 10Hz means that the scene will always have to be quasi-static, and I'm not sure these huge models will speed up enough to actually understand velocity as a 'sufficient statistic' of the underlying dynamics.Ultimately, it's been frustrating to see so much money dumped into the recent humanoid push using teleop / BC.

Now you just need to connect that to a transformer / diffusion and it will be able to perform that task autonomously maybe 80% of the time with 200+ demonstrations and close to 100% of the time with 1000+ demonstrations.Aloha was not new, but it’s still good work because robotics researchers were not focused on this form of data collection.

The issue was most people went into the simulation rabbit hole where they had to solve sim-to-real.Others went into the VR handset and hand tracking idea, where you never got super precise manipulations and so any robots trained on that always showed choppy movement.Others including OpenAI decided to go full reinforcement learning foregoing human demonstrations which had some decent results but after 6 months of RL on an arm farm led by Google and Sergey Levine, the results were underwhelming to say the least.So yes it’s not like Aloha invented teleoperation, they demonstrated that using this mode of teleoperation you could collect a lot of data that can train autonomous robot policies easily and beat other methods which I think is a great contribution!", "I’m not sure you can say that imitation learning has been under-researched in the past.

Children’s motivations radically change over their development.Reading up on normative childhood development can be very helpful as a parent.You’ll learn that at every age there are skills your child just isn’t ready to develop, even though they will need to later, and there are ones that are worth supporting them in developing.Regression is normal.
